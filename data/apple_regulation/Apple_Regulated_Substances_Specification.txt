Apple Regulated Substances Specification—069-0135-L  |  May 2021
1. Scope
It’s Apple’s mission to make sure that anyone who assembles, uses, or recycles 
an Apple product can do so safely. We have led the industry in removing many 
harmful substances from our product designs, and we go to great lengths to make 
sure that they stay that way. We are constantly designing our products to be better 
for the environment, and for people. 
This Regulated Substances Specification describes Apple’s global requirements and 
restrictions on the use of certain chemical substances or materials in Apple products, 
accessories, manufacturing processes, and packaging used for shipping products to 
Apple’s end-customers. Restrictions are derived from international laws or 
directives, regulatory agencies, eco-label requirements, environmental standards, 
and Apple policies. Apple’s restrictions may go beyond regulatory requirements in 
order to protect human health and the environment.
This specification is not an exhaustive list of all chemicals of concern. Apple suppliers 
should take action to understand the human health and environmental impacts of 
all chemicals used in the manufacturing process and present in parts and materials 
supplied to Apple. Suppliers should take action to reduce or eliminate the use of 
chemicals of concern listed in this specification as a first step, as well as comply
with all applicable regulations. Suppliers must demonstrate compliance with this 
specification and provide required documentation (including required test data, Full 
Material Disclosure (FMD), and disclosure of reportable substances). Suppliers must 
notify Apple of any changes in formulation of materials or parts.
We hold our suppliers accountable by conducting factory audits and testing materials 
and components at certified laboratories for substances of high concern. Apple 
may verify supplier data and compliance to this specification utilizing our in-house 
laboratory or external third-party certified laboratories.    
Effective Date: This specification takes effect on May 15, 2023. Prior to this date, 
revision L of the Regulated Substances Specification is in effect. 
Questions: Questions regarding the Apple Regulated Substances Specification 
should be directed to Apple at environment@apple.com.

Apple Regulated Substances Specification—069-0135-M |  March 2023

2. Definitions
Alloy: A metallic material, homogeneous on a macroscopic scale, consisting of two 
or more elements so combined that they cannot be readily separated by mechanical 
means.
Apple Policy: Apple restrictions that go beyond regulatory requirements, based on 
best industry practices or toxicological properties. 
Brominated flame retardant: Brominated organic substance that has an inhibitory 
effect on the ignition of combustible organic materials.
CAS: Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers that identify unique substances. 
Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD): Initiative that requires suppliers to provide 
information on the chemicals used in Apple manufacturing processes, to report 
practices in place to ensure compliance with occupational health and safety 
regulations and Apple requirements, and to support initiatives to advance the 
adoption of safer, environmentally preferable alternatives. See Section 12 for details.
Coating: Product in liquid, paste, or powder form that, when applied to a substrate, 
forms a layer possessing protective, decorative, and/or other specific properties. 
Metallic plating layers are exempted from coating requirements. 
Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF): Process by which packaging material is produced 
with pulp that has been bleached using a chlorine derivative such as chlorine dioxide 
(ClO2), but without the use of elemental chlorine (Cl).
Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs): Chemicals that can interfere with the 
endocrine (hormone) system to cause possible adverse effects in humans and wildlife. 
External Materials: Materials that are accessible to a customer under reasonable or 
foreseeable use. 
Final assembly: Manufacturing process involving assembly of a product that is then 
directly sold to Apple customers, retail stores, or distribution channels.
Full Material Disclosure (FMD): Initiative that requires suppliers to provide the entire 
chemical composition of the parts and materials used in Apple products to ensure 
compliance to regulatory requirements, corporate initiatives, and to support assessment 
of the impact to human and environmental health. See Section 11 for details. 
Homogeneous material: One material of uniform composition throughout or 
a material, consisting of a combination of materials, that cannot be disjointed, 
disaggregated, or separated into different materials by mechanical actions such 
as unscrewing, cutting, crushing, grinding, and abrasive processes. The definition 
is consistent with Directive 2011/65/EU on the Restriction of the Use of Certain 
Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS 2). Per this 
document, the following examples illustrate what is and is not a homogeneous material:
• A plastic cover is a homogeneous material if it consists of one type of plastic that is 
not coated with other materials, or has other materials attached to it.
• A cable that consists of metal wires surrounded by nonmetallic insulation materials isn’t 
a homogeneous material because mechanical processes could separate the different 
materials. In this case, restrictions apply to each of the separated materials individually.
• A semiconductor package contains many homogeneous materials that include the 
mold compound, die attach adhesive, die coatings, bonding wires, lead frame, and 
lead frame platings. Restrictions apply to each individual homogeneous material.
• Printed circuit board laminated materials consist of glass cloth, resins, and copper 
foil that are each a homogeneous material. Restrictions apply to each individual 
homogeneous material.
Incidentally present: Present as an unavoidable impurity or unintentional trace 
contaminant.
Intentionally added: Substance deliberately used in the formulation of a material 
or component, where the presence of the substance in the final product provides a 
specific characteristic, appearance, or quality.
Mixture: Solutions composed of two or more substances in which they do not react.
Nanomaterials: A natural, incidental, or manufactured material containing particles, 
in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an agglomerate; and where, for 
50 percent or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external 
dimensions are in the 1 nm–100 nm size range. In addition, fullerenes, graphene 
flakes, and single-wall carbon nanotubes with one or more external dimensions below 
1 nm should be considered as nanomaterials.

Future Restrictions in Manufacturing Processes  |  Supplementary Specifications  |  Demonstrating Compliance  |  Waiver Process  |  Full Material Disclosure (FMD)  |  Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD)  |  Revision History  |  Referenced Documents  |  Appendices

No intentional use: Substance must not be intentionally added. Proof of compliance 
requires either 1) the substance is not listed in “Section 3 Composition/information 
on ingredients” of submitted Safety Data Sheet (SDS), which meets Globally 
Harmonized System (GHS) cutoff value requirement or 2) chemical manufacturer 
provides self-declaration of no intentional use.
Non-use: Substance must not be intentionally or unintentionally present. Apple 
requires test reports from certified labs as proof of compliance. For all Section 6 
restrictions, the substance must be under the method detection level by using 
Apple specified analytical methods.
Packaging: Packaging materials used to enclose or protect Apple products during 
shipment to the end-customer. Packaging shipped to suppliers or OEMs (e.g., tape 
and reel, trays), and inter- and intra-factory protective packaging that does not 
remain in final product are not covered by the RSS.
Paint: Coatings containing pigments that, when applied to a substrate, form a dry
film with protective, decorative, or special functions. 
Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS): Substances that contain one or 
more perfluoroalkyl moieties, –CnF2n+1.
Personal protective equipment (PPE): Equipment for protecting manufacturing 
employees from exposure to hazardous materials in the workplace specific to the
job function.
ppb: Parts per billion by weight of a substance; equivalent to 0.001 mg/kg or 
0.0000001 percent by weight.
ppm: Parts per million by weight of a substance; equivalent to 1 mg/kg or 
0.0001 percent by weight.
Primer: Surface treatment chemical used to increase adhesion when used in 
conjunction with a coating or adhesive system. 
Process chemical: Chemicals, used on their own or in formulations, that are not 
intentionally incorporated (partly or fully) into the product. Examples of a process 
chemical: cleaning agent, degreaser, demolder solution, lubricant, metal working 
fluid, heat transfer fluid, etching solution. Examples of a non-process chemical: 
paint, coating, ink, adhesive, primer, resin, flux, solder paste.
Processed Chlorine Free (PCF): Process by which material is produced with pulp 
from virgin and/or recycled content that has been bleached without any type of 
chlorine, or that has not been bleached at all. Recycled content may have originally 
been bleached with chlorine or chlorine derivatives.
Test Report Mapping (TRM) Form: The form used to map test reports to declared 
materials. The TRM form is created in and exported from the FMD Portal. The TRM 
form and mapped test reports are collected by Apple manufacturing partners to 
document compliance of the parts and materials used in Apple products. The 
information required to create a TRM form for Apple’s manufacturing partners is the 
foundation of an FMD declaration required by Apple. These processes have been 
harmonized to eliminate duplicative work and align requirements across the Apple 
supply chain.
Textile: A flexible material made by creating an interlocking network of yarns or 
threads, which are produced by spinning raw fibers (from either natural or synthetic 
sources) into long threads. 
Totally Chlorine Free (TCF): Process by which packaging material is produced with 
pulp from virgin content that has been bleached without any type of chlorine, or that 
has not been bleached at all.
Varnish: Transparent coating material. 
Wearable products: Electronics or accessories that can be comfortably worn on the 
body, such as Apple Watch. These products will occlude the skin.

4. Reportable Substances and Future Restrictions in Products
Suppliers are required to report the use of all substances listed in Section 4, regardless of the future restriction timeline, in any homogeneous materials used in Apple products, 
accessories, and packaging as well as in any homogeneous materials applied to or cured onto parts in Apple products, accessories, and packaging. This includes the wet 
formulations of adhesives, inks, coatings, primers, and other wet formulations manufactured by the material manufacturer in addition to the cured materials in the finished good. 
In some cases, reporting is required only if the substances exceed a defined permissible limit. Apple is prioritizing the chemicals it intends to restrict in the future in order to 
work effectively with its supply chain. Suppliers are required to report via FMD Portal and/or the Test Report Mapping (TRM) form for evaluation and approval for use prior to use 
in Apple products. Where indicated, Apple expects future restrictions based on regulation or Apple Policy. Some substances will require immediate phase-out; suppliers must start 
reformulating existing or qualifying new materials that do not intentionally use the substance(s). In some cases, use will be allowed under a specific threshold limit.

5. Notifying Apple of Chemical Phase Out and Reformulation from Suppliers
Suppliers are required to communicate promptly any change in chemical manufacturing processes, manufacturing site, or any other change that will affect any attribute of the material 
either in its chemical composition (intentional or residual) or its lead time. For example, if for environmental or other purposes the supplier wishes to modify the goods or the processes, 
production lines, or site(s) used to manufacture the parts or finished goods, the supplier must provide Apple with the reason (e.g., an internal initiative to a phase out or to reformulate 
any material/part due to a chemical or any other concern), by contacting the supplier’s Apple Global Supply Manager(s) and the Apple Environmental Team at environment@apple.com 
prior to any such modification. Apple will review the submission and decide whether, or to what extent, a modification is permitted. For any such modification, the supplier must, at
a minimum, provide test reports to meet the requirements of Section 9 and test reports for other substances may also be requested. Subject to the above, suppliers must agree to 
not modify the goods or the processes used to manufacture the goods in any way after qualification without Apple’s prior written consent.
6. Restrictions in Manufacturing Processes
Restrictions in Section 6 apply to manufacturing process chemicals used to create components or materials for Apple products and the assembly of Apple products including: 
direct use during production or indirect use for manufacturing equipment, machines, or tools during maintenance. Restrictions do not apply to laboratory, housekeeping, 
wastewater treatment plant, or other non-manufacturing processes. Suppliers must comply with threshold limits for the chemicals listed in this section. Test reports are required to 
demonstrate compliance of non-use. “Non-use” and “no intentional use” are defined in Section 2. Per the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct, suppliers shall identify, evaluate, and 
manage occupational health and safety hazards through a prioritized process of hazard elimination, engineering controls, and/or administrative controls. Suppliers shall provide 
their employees with suitable job-related, appropriately maintained personal protective equipment and instruction on its proper use.

8. Supplementary Specifications
All Apple products must comply with the restrictions listed in this Regulated 
Substances Specification. In cases when new restrictions are introduced over 
a transition period, Apple may release supplementary specifications referencing 
those specific restrictions. Drawings, fabrication notes, and product specifications 
will reference the supplementary specification as applicable. The supplementary 
specifications are available to qualified suppliers upon request by contacting 
Apple at environment@apple.com.
8.1 Apple Environmental Quality Specification, 069-8496
The Apple Environmental Quality Specification sets forth Apple’s requirements for 
final assembly facilities, module suppliers, and component suppliers to maintain 
an environmental quality control program to ensure the environmental compliance
of Apple products. The environmental quality control program for supplier facilities 
must include a material declaration process, in-process controls, and audits of raw 
materials and finished goods. All final assembly and module suppliers are required 
to adhere to these requirements and provide information to Apple in a timely manner. 
8.2 Apple Regulated Substances Specification for Prolonged Skin 
Contact Materials, 099-3470
The Apple Regulated Substances Specification for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials  
applies to materials with direct or indirect prolonged skin contact in both wearable 
and non-wearable products. Materials with no or incidental skin contact will not 
need to comply with this specification. All materials, regardless of whether they are 
in prolonged skin contact, must also comply with the Apple Regulated Substances 
Specification (069-0135). 
8.3 Conflict Minerals Restrictions, 069-5202 
All suppliers of materials, parts, sub-components, components, or products 
(Component Goods) that are to be incorporated into an Apple product and 
containing tantalum, tungsten, tin, gold, or cobalt must comply with the specification 
on Conflict Minerals Restrictions, 069-5202. Suppliers may only use tin, tantalum, 
tungsten, gold, or cobalt in Component Goods if the supplier demonstrates that it 
has exercised due diligence in the sourcing of such materials and reports to Apple 
on the source and chain of custody of such metals in accordance with the OECD 
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-
Affected and High-Risk Areas. This will enable a determination as to whether those 
metals are from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or any adjoining 
country and, if so,
whether those metals directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups that 
are perpetrators of serious human rights abuses in the DRC or an adjoining country. 
Suppliers may only source tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold, or cobalt through smelters 
and refiners participating in a verification of their sourcing practices by an 
independent third-party organization or program recognized by Apple. 
Apple expects each supplier to provide complete and accurate reporting of its due 
diligence efforts for all tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold, or cobalt used in Apple Component 
Goods. Apple will audit suppliers’ Conflict Minerals data submissions to ensure 
conformity with Apple requirements. If any supplier becomes aware that it has 
sourced tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold, or cobalt that is from the DRC or any adjoining 
country and that directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups, in any 
Component Goods incorporated into Apple products, the supplier must immediately 
notify Apple in writing at mineralsreporting@apple.com.
8.4 Apple Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Specification, 
099-22549
This specification sets forth Apple’s requirements for compliance with all 
restrictions, regulations, and reporting requirements for VOC (Volatile Organic 
Compound)-containing materials applicable to Apple products and packaging, and 
related manufacturing processes. Compliance is applicable to the following 
stakeholders: all contract manufacturing partners, suppliers, and vendors, including 
all component, module, or system-level assembly facilities applying VOC-containing 
materials. Apple expects these stakeholders to ensure that materials under the 
scope of this specification used by their suppliers also comply with restrictions, 
regulations, and reporting requirements defined in this specification. 
8.5 Engineering Requirements Specification: PFAS and PFHxA 
Definitions and Substances Lists, 099-39076
This document is the material specification defining chemicals that may be 
considered “Poly- or perfluoro alkyls substances” or PFAS and “Perfluorohexanoic 
acid and its related compounds”, the most comprehensive (though non-exhaustive) 
list of PFAS and PFHxA chemicals, and information that helps material vendors 
provide information to Apple in order to satisfy Apple RSS reporting requirements for

All test reports must meet the following requirements: 
• Test reports must be no more than two years old from the date submitted to Apple 
or Apple’s manufacturing partners. Material test reports are required for each use of 
that material in a new product design. Suppliers are obligated to maintain 
appropriate  processes and systems to manage test reports so that the valid reports 
can be submitted to Apple in a timely manner. Materials tested must be 
homogeneous. 
Test reports that are not at a homogeneous material level are not acceptable 
(e.g., modules made up of several homogeneous materials tested after grinding
the entire subassembly).
• Apple requires unaltered test reports of homogeneous materials from certified labs 
as proof of compliance for the substances listed in Section 9. Digital test reports 
must be in the form of original, unaltered PDF files containing text and images as 
provided by the certified lab(s). Scanned, photographed, modified, and/or image-
only PDF files are prohibited without Apple’s prior approval, and will be rejected at 
Apple’s discretion.
• A nationally or internationally certified laboratory must issue the test report. 
Supplier-owned laboratories are acceptable if they are independently certified
and evidence of certification is submitted to environment@apple.com for approval. 
One example of international certification is ISO 17025.
• Test reports based on X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (XRF) are not acceptable 
forms of compliance documentation.
• Testing must be conducted on the material in the form present in the final Apple 
product, accessory, or retail packaging item (i.e., “dry” or “cured”).
• When conducting test method (EN14582) for halogens (Br, Cl, F), supplier must 
ensure with test laboratory that the method is validated for different halogens using 
certified reference materials.
• Test reports submitted to Apple must be issued in English or include English if a 
multilingual report.
• It is the supplier’s responsibility to provide test reports at the supplier’s expense. 
• Redacted test reports will not be accepted by Apple. They may, however, satisfy 
contract manufacturer requirements. Contact the Apple Environmental Quality Team 
for guidance as required. (Source: Current version of Apple Environmental Quality 
Specification [069-8496] on Section 4.1 General Requirement).
Apple or Apple’s manufacturing partners may request test reports on a case-by-
case basis, at the supplier’s expense, if there are concerns regarding the validity of 
the test data or compliance of the parts. 
All compliance documentation (e.g., test reports and declarations) must be retained
by the supplier for a minimum of 10 years as part of the supplier’s record-keeping 
process. Digital formats are acceptable unless otherwise noted. Suppliers are also 
expected to have compliance assurance processes and systems to control and 
maintain compliance. Refer to the Apple Environmental Quality Specification 
(069-8496) for additional information on supplier’s internal environmental quality 
assurance requirements. Questions relating to test requirements may be directed to 
Apple Global Supply Managers (GSM), or emailed to Apple at 
environment@apple.com. 
For substances that are restricted or regulated and have been replaced with an 
alternative substance, the supplier is required to ensure the alternative substance is 
an environmentally responsible substitution. Substitutions should be selected based 
on minimizing unintended consequences that might occur in phasing out a 
potentially hazardous substance. Suppliers shall conduct alternative assessments 
or obtain these assessments from their raw materials suppliers prior to making a 
replacement. Contact Apple at environment@apple.com for more information on 
conducting alternative assessments.

10.  Waiver Process
Any instances of materials exceeding the thresholds in this specification must 
immediately be reported to Apple. Suppliers that are seeking a temporary waiver of 
restrictions in the Apple Regulated Substances Specification must make the request
to Apple in writing. Apple will review the request and provide its decision via email to 
the requester. Contact Apple at environment@apple.com for more information on
this process.
11.  Full Material Disclosure (FMD)
Apple has implemented the Full Material Disclosure (FMD) initiative that requires 
suppliers to provide the entire chemical composition of the parts and materials used 
in Apple products. Implementation of FMD requires suppliers to disclose the 
complete, accurate, and precise identity of the parts and materials used in Apple 
products. Apple’s Full Material Disclosure (FMD) requirements are documented in 
the FMD Data Requirements for Part Suppliers (080-00316) and the FMD Data 
Requirements for Material Suppliers (080-01462) specifications. The use of the 
FMD data collected from suppliers is governed by the Apple FMD Data Use Policy 
(080-00967), which restricts access to and use of the FMD data submitted to 
Apple.  
Apple will audit supplier FMD data submissions to ensure conformity with the 
requirements. Apple will conduct analyses to ensure submissions accurately 
reflect the composition of the parts and materials provided. The analyses will 
include comparison of FMD data to supplier-provided test reports and may include 
comparison to Apple test reports. Please contact FMD_Support@apple.com for 
more information.
12. Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD)
Suppliers must submit the required information in Apple SupplierCare System to 
enable Apple to evaluate conformity with the requirements in Section 6 and Section 
7 of this specification. Please contact CSD@group.apple.com for more information.
