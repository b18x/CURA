General Information 
General 
H&M Group Chemical Restrictions consist of several parts regarding different product types; this document concerns Chemical Restrictions for Textile 
products, Accessories, Footwear, Bags and Belts. 
An introduction to and general information about the H&M Group Chemical Restrictions are available in a separate document: H&M Group Restricted 
Substance List (RSL) Introduction and Commitment - All Product Types, document ID 00432. Please read that document and refer to the examples provided 
there, before proceeding with the product specific restrictions.  
Each limit specified in this document is valid for homogeneous parts of the concerned product if not otherwise stated. Test methods are specified when 
relevant in this document. In case of undated test method, the latest version is valid.  
 
Please note: If other requirements than those listed in H&M Group Chemical Restrictions exist for the same substances and product groups in ZDHC 
MRSL or AFIRM RSL, the requirements specified in H&M Group Chemical Restrictions take precedence.

The substance must not be used in production and it must not be added to the product1.  
Concentration limit 
The substance must not be present in the product at concentrations above this limit. 
Homogeneous 
Uniform composition throughout, i.e. a material that cannot be mechanically disjointed into different materials. 
Not detected 
The substance must not be present in the finished product at concentrations above the analytical reporting limit. 
Reporting limit  
Describes the level of detection times a safety factor selected by the laboratory that ensures repeatability and 
reproducibility.

General Information 
General Information 
1. Chemical Restrictions – Production 
For Textile and Leather supply chains, manufacturing shall comply with the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals Manufacturing Restricted Substance List 3.1 (ZDHC MRSL 
3.1).  ZDHC MRSL 3.1 is retrieved here: //mrsl.roadmaptozero.com/.  
Compliance to ZDHC MRSL is a Minimum Requirement (MR). Therefore, if the production unit is found to intentionally use chemicals listed on ZDHC MRSL in production 
process, it will result in MR Violation. 
2. Chemical Restrictions – Products 
Products within the scope of H&M Group Chemical Restrictions Textile products, Accessories, Footwear, Bags and Belts shall comply with AFIRM’s Restricted Substances List 
(RSL), found at www.afirm-group.com/afirm-rsl/
