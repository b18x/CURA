ANNEX VII 
STANDARD INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBSTANCES 
MANUFACTURED OR IMPORTED IN QUANTITIES OF ONE TONNE 
OR MORE ( 1 ) 
Column 1 of this Annex establishes the standard information required for: 
(a) non-phase-in substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 1 to 10 
tonnes; 
(b) phase-in substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 1 to 10 tonnes 
and meeting the criteria in Annex III in accordance with Article 12(1)(a) and 
(b); and 
(c) substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 10 tonnes or more. 
Any other relevant physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological 
information that is available shall be provided. For substances not meeting the 
criteria in Annex III only the physicochemical requirements as set out in section 
7 of this Annex are required. 
Column 2 of this Annex lists specific rules according to which the required 
standard information may be omitted, replaced by other information, provided 
at a different stage or adapted in another way. If the conditions are met under 
which column 2 of this Annex allows adaptations, the registrant shall clearly 
state this fact and the reasons for each adaptation under the appropriate headings 
in the registration dossier. 
▼M51 
Without prejudice to the information submitted for other forms, any relevant 
physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological information shall include 
characterisation of the nanoform tested and test conditions. A justification shall 
be provided where QSARs are used or evidence is obtained by means other than 
testing, as well as a description of the range of the characteristics/properties of 
the nanoforms to which the evidence can be applied. 
▼C1 
In addition to these specific rules, a registrant may adapt the required standard 
information set out in column 1 of this Annex according to the general rules 
contained in Annex XI with the exception of Section 3 on substance-tailored 
exposure waiving. In this case as well, he shall clearly state the reasons for any 
decision to adapt the standard information under the appropriate headings in the 
registration dossier referring to the appropriate specific rule(s) in column 2 or in 
Annex XI ( 2 ). 
Before new tests are carried out to determine the properties listed in this Annex, 
all available in vitro data, in vivo data, historical human data, data from valid 
(Q)SARs and data from structurally related substances (read-across approach) 
shall be assessed first. In vivo testing with corrosive substances at concen­
tration/dose levels causing corrosivity shall be avoided. Prior to testing, further 
guidance on testing strategies should be consulted in addition to this Annex. 
▼M64 
Where a test method offers flexibility in the study design, for example in relation 
to the choice of dose levels, the chosen study design shall ensure that the data 
generated are adequate for hazard identification and risk assessment. To this end, 
▼C1 
( 1 ) This Annex shall apply to producers of articles that are required to register in accordance 
with Article 7 and to other downstream users that are required to carry out tests under 
this Regulation adapted as necessary. 
( 2 ) Note: conditions for not requiring a specific test that are set out in the appropriate test 
methods in the Commission Regulation on test methods as specified in Article 13(3) that 
are not repeated in column 2, also apply.

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 167 
testing shall be performed at appropriately high dose levels. If dose (concen­
tration) selection is limited by the physicochemical properties or biological 
effects of the test substance, justification shall be provided. 
▼C1 
When, for certain endpoints, information is not provided for other reasons than 
those mentioned in column 2 of this Annex or in Annex XI, this fact and the 
reasons shall also be clearly stated.

SUBSTANCE 
COLUMN 1 
STANDARD INFORMATION 
REQUIRED 
COLUMN 2 
SPECIFIC RULES FOR ADAPTATION FROM COLUMN 1 
7.1. 
State of the substance at 
20 °C and 101,3 kPa 
7.2. 
Melting/freezing point 
7.2. 
The study does not need to be conducted below a 
lower limit of - 20 °C. 
7.3. 
Boiling point 
7.3. 
The study does not need to be conducted: 
— for gases, or 
— for solids which either melt above 300 °C or 
decompose before boiling. In such cases the 
boiling point under reduced pressure may be 
estimated or measured, or 
— for substances which decompose before boiling 
(e.g. auto-oxidation, rearrangement, degradation, 
decomposition, etc.). 
7.4. 
Relative density 
7.4. 
The study does not need to be conducted if: 
— the substance is only stable in solution in a 
particular solvent and the solution density is 
similar to that of the solvent. In such cases, an 
indication of whether the solution density is 
higher or lower than the solvent density is suffi­
cient, or 
— the substance is a gas. In this case, an estimation 
based on calculation shall be made from its 
molecular weight and the Ideal Gas Laws. 
7.5. 
Vapour pressure 
7.5. 
The study does not need to be conducted if the 
melting point is above 300 °C. 
If the melting point is between 200 °C and 300 °C, a 
limit value based on measurement or a recognised 
calculation method is sufficient. 
►M64 7.6. Surface tension of an 
aqueous solution ◄ 
7.6. 
The study need only be conducted if: 
— based on structure, surface activity is expected or 
can be predicted, or 
— surface activity is a desired property of the 
material. 
If the water solubility is below 1 mg/l at 20 °C the 
test does not need to be conducted. 
▼M51 
7.7. 
Water solubility 
For nanoforms, in addition 
the testing of dissolution 
rate in water as well as in 
relevant biological and envi­
ronmental media shall be 
considered. 
7.7. 
The study does not need to be conducted if: 
— the substance is hydrolytically unstable at pH 4, 7 
and 9 (half-life less than 12 hours), or 
— the substance is readily oxidisable in water. 
If the substance appears ‘insoluble’ in water, a limit 
test up to the detection limit of the analytical method 
shall be performed.
