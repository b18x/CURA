Suppliers placing a mixture on the market for use 
for tattooing purposes shall ensure that, after 
4 January 2022, the mixture is marked with the 
following information: 
(a) the statement ‘Mixture for use in tattoos or 
permanent make-up’;

This entry does not apply to substances that are 
gases at temperature of 20 °C and pressure of 101,3 
kPa, or generate a vapour pressure of more than 300 
kPa at temperature of 50 °C, with the exception of 
formaldehyde (CAS No 50-00-0, EC No 200-001-8). 
10. This entry does not apply to the placing on the

or an accessory to a medical device, within the 
meaning of Regulation (EU) 2017/745, or when 
used exclusively as a medical device or an accessory 
to a medical device, within the same meaning. 
Where the placing on the market or use may not be 
exclusively as a medical device or an accessory to a 
medical device, the requirements of Regulation (EU) 
2017/745 and of this Regulation shall apply 
cumulatively.

FOREWORD 
Explanations of column headings 
Substances: 
The name corresponds to the International Chemical Identification used for the 
substance in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council on classification, labelling and 
packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 
67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. 
Whenever possible, substances are designated by their IUPAC names. Substances 
listed in Einecvs (European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical 
Substances), Elincs (European List of Notified Substances) or the list of ‘No- 
longer-polymers’ are designated using the names in these lists. Other names, such 
as usual or common names, are included in some cases. Whenever possible, plant 
protection products and biocides are designated by their ISO names. 
Entries for groups of substances: 
A number of group entries are included in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation 
(EC) No 1272/2008. In these cases, the classification requirements will apply to 
all substances covered by the description. 
In some cases, there are classification requirements for specific substances that 
would be covered by the group entry. In such cases a specific entry is included in 
Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 for the substance and the 
group entry will be annotated with the phrase ‘except those specified elsewhere 
in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008’. 
In some cases, individual substances may be covered by more than one group 
entry. In these cases, the classification of the substance reflects the classification 
for each of the two group entries. In cases where different classifications for the 
same hazard are given, the most severe classification will be applied. 
Index number: 
The Index number is the identification code given to the substance in Part 3 of 
Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. Substances are listed in the 
Appendix according to this index number. 
EC numbers: 
The EC number, i.e. Einecs, Elincs or NLP, is the official number of the 
substance within the European Union. The Einecs number can be obtained 
from the European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical Substance 
(Einecs). The Elincs number can be obtained from the European List of 
Notified Substances. The NLP number can be obtained from the list of ‘No- 
longer-polymers’. These lists are published by the Office for Official Publications 
of the European Communities. 
The EC number is a seven-digit system of the type XXX-XXX-X which starts at 
200-001-8 (Einecs), at 400-010-9 (Elincs) and at 500-001-0 (NLP). This number
