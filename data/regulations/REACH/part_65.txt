For the purposes of this entry: 
(i) ‘professional’ means any natural or legal person, 
including workers and self-employed workers 
undertaking paint stripping in the course of their 
professional activity outside an industrial instal- 
lation; 
(ii) ‘industrial installation’ means a facility used for 
paint stripping activities. 
2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member 
States may allow on their territories and for certain 
activities the use, by specifically trained professionals, of 
paint strippers containing dichloromethane and may 
allow the placing on the market of such paint strippers 
for supply to those professionals. 
Member States making use of this derogation shall define 
appropriate provisions for the protection of the health and 
safety of those professionals using paint strippers 
containing dichloromethane and shall inform the Com- 
mission thereof. 
Those provisions shall include a requirement that a 
professional shall hold a certificate that is accepted by the 
Member State in which that professional operates, or 
provide other documentary evidence to that effect, or be 
otherwise approved by that Member State, so as to 
demonstrate proper training and competence to safely use 
paint strippers containing dichloromethane. 
The Commission shall prepare a list of the Member 
States which have made use of the derogation in this 
paragraph and make it publicly available over the 
Internet. 
3.   A professional benefiting from the derogation 
referred to in paragraph 2 shall operate only in Member 
States which have made use of that derogation. The 
training referred to in paragraph 2 shall cover as a 
minimum: 
(a) awareness, evaluation and management of risks to 
health, including information on existing substitutes 
or processes, which under their conditions of use are 
less hazardous to the health and safety of workers; 
(b) use of adequate ventilation; 
(c) use of appropriate personal protective equipment that 
complies with Directive 89/686/EEC. 
Employers and self-employed workers shall preferably 
replace dichloromethane with a chemical agent or process 
which, under its conditions of use, presents no risk, or a 
lower risk, to the health and safety of workers.

the following minimum conditions are met: 
(a) effective ventilation in all processing areas, in 
particular for the wet processing and the drying of 
stripped articles: local exhaust ventilation at strip 
tanks supplemented by forced ventilation in those 
areas, so as to minimise exposure and to ensure 
compliance, where technically feasible, with relevant 
occupational exposure limits; 
(b) measures to minimise evaporation from strip tanks 
comprising: lids for covering strip tanks except 
during loading and unloading; suitable loading and 
unloading arrangements for strip tanks; and wash 
tanks with water or brine to remove excess solvent 
after unloading; 
(c) measures for the safe handling of dichloromethane in 
strip tanks comprising: pumps and pipework for 
transferring paint stripper to and from strip tanks; and 
suitable arrangements for safe cleaning of tanks and 
removal of sludge; 
(d) personal protective equipment that complies with 
Directive 89/686/EEC comprising: suitable protec-
