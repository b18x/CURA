ormation needs for the substance with 
the information already available and the extent to which currently available 
information can be applied to all nanoforms covered by the registration and 
identify where there are gaps. 
It is important at this stage to ensure that the available data is relevant and has 
sufficient quality to fulfil the requirements.

STEP 4 — GENERATE NEW DATA/PROPOSE TESTING STRATEGY 
In some cases it will not be necessary to generate new data. However, where 
there is an information gap that needs to be filled, new data shall be generated 
(Annexes VII and VIII), or a testing strategy shall be proposed (Annexes IX and 
X), depending on the tonnage. New tests on vertebrates shall only be conducted 
or proposed as a last resort when all other data sources have been exhausted. 
The above approach shall also apply if there is a gap of available information for 
one or more nanoforms of the substance included in the jointly submitted regis­
tration dossier. 
In some cases, the rules set out in Annexes VII to XI may require certain tests to 
be undertaken earlier than or in addition to the standard requirements. 
NOTES 
Note 1: If it is not technically possible, or if it does not appear scientifically 
necessary to give information, the reasons shall be clearly stated, in accordance 
with the relevant provisions. 
Note 2: The registrant may wish to declare that certain information submitted in 
the registration dossier is commercially sensitive and its disclosure might harm 
him commercially. If this is the case, he shall list the items and provide a 
justification.
