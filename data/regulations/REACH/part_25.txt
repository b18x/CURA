Article 138 
Review 
1. 
By 1 June 2019, the Commission shall carry out a review to assess 
whether or not to extend the application of the obligation to perform a 
chemical safety assessment and to document it in a chemical safety report 
to substances not covered by this obligation because they are not subject 
to registration or subject to registration but manufactured or imported in 
quantities of less than 10 tonnes per year. ►M3 However, for 
substances meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard classes 
carcinogenicity, germ cell mutagenicity or reproductive toxicity, 
category 1A or 1B, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, 
the review shall be carried out by 1 June 2014. ◄ When carrying out the 
review the Commission shall take into account all relevant factors, 
including: 
(a) the costs for manufacturers and importers of drawing up the 
chemical safety reports; 
(b) the distribution of costs between actors in the supply chain and the 
downstream user; 
(c) the benefits for human health and the environment. 
On the basis of these reviews, the Commission may, if appropriate, 
present legislative proposals to extend this obligation. 
2. 
The Commission may present legislative proposals as soon as a 
practicable and cost-efficient way of selecting polymers for registration 
on the basis of sound technical and valid scientific criteria can be 
established, and after publishing a report on the following: 
(a) the risks posed by polymers in comparison with other substances; 
(b) the need, if any, to register certain types of polymer, taking account 
of competitiveness and innovation on the one hand and the 
protection of human health and the environment on the other. 
3. 
The report, referred to in Article 117(4), on the experience 
acquired with the operation of this Regulation shall include a review 
of the requirements relating to registration of substances manufactured 
or imported only in quantities starting at one tonne but less than 10 
tonnes per year per manufacturer or importer. On the basis of that 
review, the Commission may present legislative proposals to modify 
the information requirements for substances manufactured or imported 
in quantities of one tonne or more up to 10 tonnes per year per manu­
facturer or importer, taking into account the latest developments, for 
example in relation to alternative testing and (quantitative) structure- 
activity relationships ((Q)SARs). 
4. 
The Commission shall carry out a review of Annexes I, IV and V 
by 1 June 2008, with a view to proposing amendments, if appropriate, 
to them in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 131. 
5.

substances which are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic or very 
persis
