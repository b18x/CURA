water the depth of which at low tide does not 
exceed 6 metres; 
(b) ‘gunshot’ means pellets used or intended for use 
in a single charge or cartridge in a shotgun; 
(c) ‘shotgun’ means a smooth-bore gun, excluding 
airguns; 
(d) ‘shooting’ means any shooting with a shotgun; 
(e) ‘carrying’ means any carrying on the person or 
carrying or transporting by any other means; 
(f) in determining whether a person found with 
gunshot is carrying gunshot ‘as part of going 
shooting’: 
(i) regard shall be had to all the circumstances 
of the case; 
(ii) the person found with the gunshot need not 
necessarily be the same person as the person 
shooting. 
14. Member States may maintain national provisions for 
protection of the environment or human health in 
force on 15 February 2021 and restricting lead in 
gunshot more severely than provided for in para- 
graph 11. 
The Member State shall communicate the text of 
those national provisions to the Commission without 
delay. The Commission shall make publicly avail- 
able without delay any such texts of national 
provisions received by it. ◄

Shall not be placed on the market or used, as a 
substance or as a constituent of mixtures in a concen­
tration equal to or greater than 1 % by weight, where 
the substance or the mixture is placed on the market for 
use or used as an air freshener or deodoriser in toilets, 
homes, offices or other indoor public areas.

65. Inorganic ammonium salts 
1. Shall not be placed on the market, or used, in 
cellulose insulation mixtures or cellulose insulation 
articles after 14 July 2018 unless the emission of 
ammonia from those mixtures or articles results in 
a concentration of less than 3 ppm by volume 
(2,12 mg/m 3 ) under the test conditions specified in 
paragraph 4. 
A supplier of a cellulose insulation mixture 
containing inorganic ammonium salts shall inform 
the recipient or consumer of the maximum 
permissible loading rate of the cellulose insulation 
mixture, expressed in thickness and density. 
A downstream user of a cellulose insulation mixture 
containing inorganic ammonium salts shall ensure 
that 
the 
maximum 
permissible 
loading 
rate 
communicated by the supplier is not exceeded. 
2. By way of derogation, paragraph 1 shall not apply to 
placing on the market of cellulose insulation 
mixtures intended to be used solely for the 
production of cellulose insulation articles, or to the 
use of those mixtures in the production of cellulose 
insulation articles. 
3. In the case of a Member State that, on 14 July 2016, 
has national provisional measures in place that have 
been authorised by the Commission pursuant to 
Article 129(2)(a), the provisions of paragraphs 1 
and 2 shall apply from that date. 
4. Compliance with the emission limit specified in the 
first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be demon­
strated in accordance with Technical Specification 
CEN/TS 16516, adapted as follows: 
(a) the duration of the test shall be at least 14 days 
instead of 28 days; 
(b) the ammonia gas emission shall be measured at 
least once per day throughout the test; 
(c) the emission limit shall not be reached or 
exceeded in any measurement taken during the 
test; 
(d) the relative humidity shall be 90 % instead of 
50 %; 
(e) an appropriate method to measure the ammonia 
gas emission shall be used; 
(f) the loading rate, expressed in thickness and 
density, shall be recorded during the sampling 
of the cellulose insulation mixtures or articles 
to be tested.
