Information with regard to physical hazard classes 
This subsection lists properties, safety characteristics and test results, 
which may be useful to include in the safety data sheet when a 
substance or mixture is classified in the respective physical hazard 
class. Data deemed relevant with regard to a specific physical hazard 
but not resulting in classification (e.g. negative test results close to the 
criterion), may also be appropriate to indicate. 
The name of the hazard class to which the data relate may be 
indicated together with the data.
