Information shall be provided on other hazards which do not result in 
classification but which may contribute to the overall hazards of the 
substance or mixture, such as formation of air contaminants during 
hardening or processing, dustiness, explosive properties which do not 
fulfil the classification criteria of part 2 Section 2.1 of Annex I to 
Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, dust explosion hazards, cross-sensiti­
sation, suffocation, freezing, high potency for odour or taste, or envi­
ronmental effects like hazards to soil-dwelling organisms, or photo­
chemical ozone creation potential. The statement ‘May form 
explosible dust-air mixture if dispersed’ is appropriate in the case 
of a dust explosion hazard.

SECTION 3: Composition/information on ingredients 
This section of the safety data sheet shall describe the chemical 
identity of the ingredient(s) of the substance or mixture, including 
impurities and stabilising additives as set out below. Appropriate and 
available safety information on surface chemistry shall be indicated. 
3.1. 
Substances 
The chemical identity of the main constituent of the substance shall 
be provided by providing at least the product identifier or one of the 
other means of identification given in subsection 1.1. 
The chemical identity of any impurity, stabilising additive, or indi­
vidual constituent other than the main constituent, which is itself 
classified and which contributes to the classification of the 
substance shall be provided as follows: 
(a) the product identifier in accordance with Article 18(2) of Regu­
lation (EC) No 1272/2008; 
(b) if the product identifier is not available, one of the other names 
(usual name, trade name, abbreviation) or identification numbers. 
The specific concentration limit, the M-factor and the acute toxicity 
estimate for substances included in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation 
(EC) No 1272/2008 or determined in accordance with Annex I to that 
Regulation shall be indicated, if available. 
If the substance is registered and it covers a nanoform, the particle 
characteristics that specify the nanoform, as described in Annex VI, 
shall be indicated. 
If the substance is not registered, but the safety data sheet covers 
nanoforms, the particle characteristics of which have impact on the 
safety of the substance, those characteristics shall be indicated. 
Suppliers of substances may choose to list in addition all constituents 
including non-classified ones. 
This subsection may also be used to provide information on multi- 
constituent substances. 
3.2. 
Mixtures 
The product identifier, the concentration or concentration ranges and 
the classifications shall be provided for at least all substances referred 
to in points 3.2.1 or 3.2.2. Suppliers of mixtures may choose to list in 
addition all substances in the mixture, including substances not 
meeting the criteria for classification. This information shall enable 
the recipient to identify readily the hazards of the substances in the 
mixture. The hazards of the mixture itself shall be given in section 2.
