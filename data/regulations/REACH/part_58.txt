the level of detail and scope of the SEA, or contributions to them, shall 
be the responsibility of the applicant for authorisation, or, in the case of a 
proposed restriction, the interested party. The information provided can address 
the socio-economic impacts at any level. 
An SEA may include the following elements: 
— impact of a granted or refused authorisation on the applicant(s), or, in the 
case of a proposed restriction, the impact on industry (e.g. manufacturers and 
importers). The impact on all other actors in the supply chain, downstream 
users and associated businesses in terms of commercial consequences such as 
impact on investment, research and development, innovation, one-off and 
operating costs (e.g. compliance, transitional arrangements, changes to 
existing processes, reporting and monitoring systems, installation of new 
technology, etc.) taking into account general trends in the market and tech­
nology, 
— impacts of a granted or refused authorisation, or a proposed restriction, on 
consumers. For example, product prices, changes in composition or quality or 
performance of products, availability of products, consumer choice, as well as 
effects on human health and the environment to the extent that these affect 
consumers, 
— social implications of a granted or refused authorisation, or a proposed 
restriction. For example job security and employment, 
— availability, suitability, and technical feasibility of alternative substances 
and/or technologies, and economic consequences thereof, and information 
on the rates of, and potential for, technological change in the sector(s) 
concerned. In the case of an application for authorisation, the social and/or 
economic impacts of using any available alternatives, 
— wider implications on trade, competition and economic development (in 
particular for SMEs and in relation to third countries) of a granted or 
refused authorisation, or a proposed restriction. This may include consider­
ation of local, regional, national or international aspects, 
— in the case of a proposed restriction, proposals for other regulatory or non- 
regulatory measures that could meet the aim of the proposed restriction (this 
shall take account of existing legislation). This should include an assessment 
of the effectiveness and the costs linked to alternative risk management 
measures, 
— in the case of a proposed restriction or refused authorisation, the benefits for 
human health and the environment as well as the social and economic 
benefits of the proposed restriction. For example, worker health, environmen­
tal performance and the distribution of these benefits, for example, geographi­
cally, population groups, 
— an SEA may also address any other issue that is considered to be relevant by 
the applicant(s) or interested party.
