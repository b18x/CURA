ANNEX XV 
DOSSIERS 
I. 
INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL PROVISIONS 
This Annex lays down general principles for preparing dossiers to propose 
and justify: 
▼M3 
__________ 
— the identification of CMRs, PBTs, vPvBs, or a substance of equivalent 
concern in accordance with Article 59, 
▼C1 
— restrictions of the manufacture, placing on the market or use of a 
substance within the Community. 
The relevant parts of Annex I shall be used for the methodology and 
format of any dossier according to this Annex. 
For all dossiers any relevant information from registration dossiers shall 
be considered and other available information may be used. For hazard 
information which has not been previously submitted to the Agency, a 
robust study summary shall be included in the dossier. 
II. 
CONTENT OF DOSSIERS 
▼M3 __________ 
▼C1 
2. 
Dossier for the identification of a substance as a CMR, PBT, vPvB or 
a substance of equivalent concern according to Article 59 
Proposal 
The proposal shall include the identity of substance(s) concerned and 
whether it is proposed to be identified as a CMR according to 
Article 57(a), (b) or (c), a PBT according to Article 57(d), a vPvB 
according to Article 57(e), or a substance of equivalent concern 
according to Article 57(f). 
Justification 
A comparison of the available information with the criteria in Annex XIII 
for PBT according to Article 57(d), and vPvBs according to Article 57(e), 
or an assessment of the hazards and a comparison with Article 57(f), 
according to the relevant parts of Sections 1 to 4 of Annex I shall be 
completed. This shall be documented in the format set out in Part B of the 
Chemical Safety Report in Annex I. 
Information on exposures, alternative substances and risks 
The available use and exposure information and information on alternative 
substances and techniques shall be provided. 
3. 
Dossiers for restrictions proposal 
Proposal 
The proposal shall include the identity of the substance and the restric­
tion(s) proposed for the manufacture, placing on the market or use(s) and 
a summary of the justification.

02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 233 
Information on hazard and risk 
The risks to be addressed with the restriction shall be described based on 
an assessment of the hazard and risks according to the relevant parts of 
Annex I and shall be documented in the format set out in Part B of that 
Annex for the Chemical Safety Report. 
Evidence shall be provided that implemented risk management measures 
(including those identified in registrations under Articles 10 to 14) are not 
sufficient. 
Information on alternatives 
Available information on alternative substances and techniques shall be 
provided, including: 
— information on the risks to human health and the environment related 
to the manufacture or use of the alternatives, 
— availability, including the time scale, 
— technical and economical feasibility. 
Justification for Restrictions at Community Level 
Justification shall be provided that: 
— action is required on a Community-wide basis, 
— a restriction is the most appropriate Community wide measure which 
shall be assessed using the following criteria: 
(i) effectiveness: the restriction must be targeted to the effects or 
exposures that cause the risks identified, capable of reducing 
these risks to an acceptable level within a reasonable period of 
time and proportional to the risk; 
(ii) practicality: the restriction must be implementable, enforceable 
and manageable; 
(iii) monitorability: it must be possible to monitor the result of the 
implementation of the proposed restriction. 
Socio-economic assessment 
The socio-economic impacts of the proposed restriction may be analysed 
with reference to Annex XVI. To this end, the net benefits to human 
health and the environment of the proposed restriction may be compared 
to its net costs to manufacturers, importers, downstream users, 
distributors, consumers and society as a whole. 
Information on stakeholder consultation 
Information on any consultation of stakeholders and how their views have 
been taken into account shall be included in the dossier.

ANNEX XVI 
SOCIO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
This Annex outlines the information that may be addressed by those submitting a 
socio-economic analysis (SEA) with an application for authorisation, as specified 
in Article 62(5)(a), or in connection with a proposed restriction, as specified in 
Article 69(6)(b). 
The Agency shall prepare guidance for the preparation of SEAs. SEAs, or 
contributions to them, shall be submitted in the format specified by the 
Agency in accordance with Article 111. 
However,
