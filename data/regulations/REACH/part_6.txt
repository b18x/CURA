ons 8.6 and 8.7, Annex IX and Annex X may be omitted where 
justified by information on exposure and implemented risk management 
measures as specified in Annex XI, section 3. 
2. 
These methods shall be regularly reviewed and improved with a 
view to reducing testing on vertebrate animals and the number of 
animals involved. The Commission, following consultation with 
relevant stakeholders, shall, as soon as possible, make a proposal, if 
appropriate, to amend the Commission Regulation on test methods 
adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 133(4), 
and the Annexes of this Regulation, if relevant, so as to replace, reduce 
or refine animal testing. Amendments to that Commission Regulation 
shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure specified in 
paragraph 3 and amendments to the Annexes of this Regulation shall 
be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 131. 
3. 
Where tests on substances are required to generate information on 
intrinsic properties of substances, they shall be conducted in accordance 
with the test methods laid down in a Commission Regulation or in 
accordance with other international test methods recognised by the 
Commission or the Agency as being appropriate. The Commission 
shall adopt that Regulation, designed to amend the non-essential 
elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, in accordance with 
the procedure referred to in Article 133(4). 
Information on intrinsic properties of substances may be generated in 
accordance with other test methods provided that the conditions set out 
in Annex XI are met.

Ecotoxicological and toxicological tests and analyses shall be 
carried out in compliance with the principles of good laboratory 
practice provided for in Directive 2004/10/EC or other international 
standards recognised as being equivalent by the Commission or the 
Agency and with the provisions of Directive 86/609/EEC, if applicable. 
5. 
If a substance has already been registered, a new registrant shall 
be entitled to refer to the study summaries or robust study summaries, 
for the same substance submitted earlier, provided that he can show that 
the substance that he is now registering is the same as the one 
previously registered, including the degree of purity and the nature of 
impurities, and that the previous registrant(s) have given permission to 
refer to the full study reports for the purpose of registration. 
A new registrant shall not refer to such studies in order to provide the 
information required in Section 2 of Annex VI.

Chemical safety report and duty to apply and recommend risk 
reduction measures 
1. 
Without prejudice to Article 4 of Directive 98/24/EC, a chemical 
safety assessment shall be performed and a chemical safety report 
completed for all substances subject to registration in accordance with 
this Chapter in quantities of 10 tonnes or more per year per registrant. 
The chemical safety report shall document the chemical safety 
assessment which shall be conducted in accordance with paragraphs 2 
to 7 and with Annex I for either each substance on its own or in a 
►M3 mixture ◄ or in an article or a group of substances.

2. 
A chemical safety assessment in accordance with paragraph 1 need 
not be performed for a substance which is present in a mixture if the 
concentration of the substance in the mixture is less than: 
(a) the cut-off value referred to in Article 11, paragraph 3 of Regulation 
(EC) No 1272/2008; 
(b) 0,1 % weight by weight (w/w), if the substance meets the criteria in 
Annex XIII to this Regulation.

3. 
A chemical safety assessment of a substance shall include the 
following steps: 
(a) human health hazard assessment; 
(b) physicochemical hazard assessment; 
(c) environmental hazard assessment; 
(d) persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) and very persistent and 
very bioaccumulative (vPvB) assessment.

If, as a result of carrying out steps (a) to (d) of paragraph 3, the 
registrant concludes that the substance fulfils the criteria for any of the 
following hazard classes or categories set out in Annex I to Regulation

fertility or on development, 3.8 effects other than narcotic effects, 
3.9 and 3.10; 
(c) hazard class 4.1; 
(d) hazard class 5.1, 
or is assessed to be a PBT or vPvB, the chemical safety assessment 
shall include the following additional steps: 
▼C1 
(a) exposure assessment including the generation of exposure scen­
ario(s) (or the identification of relevant use and exposure categories 
if appropriate) and exposure estimation; 
(b) risk characterisation. 
The exposure scenarios (where appropriate the use and exposure 
categories), exposure assessment and risk characterisation shall 
address all identified uses of the registrant. 
5. 
The chemical safety report need not include consideration of the 
risks to human health from the following end uses: 
(a) in food contact materials within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 
1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 
27 October 2004 on materials and articles intended to come into

Any registrant shall identify and apply the appropriate measures to 
adequately control the risks identified in the chemical safety assessment, 
and where suitable, recommend them in the safety data sheets which he 
supplies in accordance with Article 31.
