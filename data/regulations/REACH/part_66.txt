referred to in paragraph 1 and, if appropriate, 
modify this entry accordingly. ◄ 
►M31 7. Shall not be placed on the market or used in 
articles supplied to the general public, if the 
concentration of lead (expressed as metal) in 
those articles or accessible parts thereof is 
equal to or greater than 0,05 % by weight, 
and those articles or accessible parts thereof 
may, during normal or reasonably foresee- 
able conditions of use, be placed in the 
mouth by children. 
That limit shall not apply where it can be 
demonstrated that the rate of lead release 
from such an article or any such accessible 
part of an article, whether coated or un- 
coated, does not exceed 0,05 μg/cm 2 per 
hour (equivalent to 0,05 μg/g/h), and, for 
coated articles, that the coating is sufficient 
to ensure that this release rate is not 
exceeded for a period of at least two years 
of normal or reasonably foreseeable condi- 
tions of use of the article. 
For the purposes of this paragraph, it is
