The study does not need to be conducted if the 
substance is inorganic. If the test cannot be 
performed (e.g. the substance decomposes, has a 
high surface activity, reacts violently during the 
performance of the test or does not dissolve in 
water or in octanol, or it is not possible to obtain a 
sufficiently pure substance), a calculated value for 
log P as well as details of the calculation method 
shall be provided. 
For nanoforms the potential confounding effect of 
dispersion in octanol and water shall be assessed 
when conducting the study. 
For nanoforms, whether of inorganic or organic 
substances, for which the partition coefficient n- 
octanol/water is not applicable the study of 
dispersion stability shall be considered instead.

7.9. 
Flash-point 
7.9. 
The study does not need to be conducted if: 
— the substance is inorganic, or 
— the substance only contains volatile organic 
components with flash-points above 100 °C for 
aqueous solutions, or 
— the estimated flash-point is above 200 °C, or 
— the flash-point can be accurately predicted by 
interpolation 
from 
existing 
characterised 
materials. 
7.10. Flammability 
7.10. The study does not need to be conducted: 
— if the substance is a solid which possesses 
explosive or pyrophoric properties. These prop­
erties should always be considered before 
considering flammability, or 
— for gases, if the concentration of the flammable 
gas in a mixture with inert gases is so low that, 
when mixed with air, the concentration is all time 
below the lower limit, or 
— for substances which spontaneously ignite when 
in contact with air. 
7.11. Explosive properties 
7.11. The study does not need to be conducted if: 
— there are no chemical groups associated with 
explosive properties present in the molecule, or 
— the substance contains chemical groups associ- 
ated with explosive properties which include 
oxygen and the calculated oxygen balance is 
less than -200, or

— the organic substance or a homogenous mixture 
of organic substances contains chemical groups 
associated with explosive properties, but the 
exothermic decomposition energy is less than 
500 J/g and the onset of exothermic decom­
position is below 500 °C, or 
— for mixtures of inorganic oxidising substances 
(UN Division 5.1) with organic materials, the 
concentration 
of 
the 
inorganic 
oxidising 
substance is: 
— less than 15 %, by mass, if assigned to UN 
Packaging Group I (high hazard) or II 
(medium hazard), 
— less than 30 %, by mass, if assigned to UN 
Packaging Group III (low hazard). 
Note: Neither a test for propagation of detonation nor 
a test for sensitivity to detonative shock is required if 
the exothermic decomposition energy of organic 
materials is less than 800 J/g. 
7.12. Self-ignition temperature 
7.12. The study does not need to be conducted: 
— if the substance is explosive or ignites sponta­
neously with air at room temperature, or 
— for liquids non flammable in air, e.g. no flash 
point up to 200 °C, or 
— for gases having no flammable range, or 
— for solids, if the substance has a melting point ≤ 
160 °C, or if preliminary results exclude self- 
heating of the substance up to 400 °C. 
7.13. Oxidising properties 
7.13. The study does not need to be conducted if: 
— the substance is explosive, or 
— the substance is highly flammable, or 
— the substance is an organic peroxide, or 
— the substance is incapable of reacting exother­
mically with combustible materials, for example 
on the basis of the chemical structure (e.g. 
organic substances not containing oxygen or 
halogen atoms and these elements are not 
chemically bonded to nitrogen or oxygen, or 
inorganic substances not containing oxygen or 
halogen atoms). 
The full test does not need to be conducted for solids 
if the preliminary test clearly indicates that the test 
substance has oxidising properties. 
Note that as there is no test method to determine the 
oxidising 
properties of gaseous 
mixtures, the 
evaluation of these properties must be realised by 
an estimation method based on the comparison of 
the oxidising potential of gases in a mixture with 
that of the oxidising potential of oxygen in air. 
7.14. Granulometry 
7.14. The study does not need to be conducted if the 
substance is marketed or used in a non solid or 
granular form.

Skin corrosion/irritation 
8.1. 
The study/ies do(es) not need to be conducted if: 
— the substance is a strong acid (pH ≤ 2,0) or base 
(pH ≥ 11,5) and the available information 
indicates that it should be classified as skin 
corrosion (Category 1), or 
— the substance is spontaneously flammable in air or 
in contact with water or moisture at room 
temperature, or 
— the substance is classified as acute toxicity by the 
dermal route (Category 1), or 
— an acute toxicity study by the dermal route does 
not indicate skin irritation up to the limit dose 
level (2 000 mg/kg body weight). 
If results from one of the two studies under point 
8.1.1 or 8.1.2 already allow a conclusive decision 
on the classification of a substance or on the 
absence of skin irritation potential, the second study 
need not be conducted.

leading to classification as serious eye damage

— the substance is classified as skin irritation and the 
available information indicates that it should be 
classified as eye irritation (Category 2), or

Skin sensitisation 
Information allowing: 
— a conclusion whether the 
substance 
is 
a 
skin 
sensitiser and whether it 
can be presumed to have 
the potential to produce 
significant 
sensitisation 
in humans (Cat. 1A), and 
— risk assessment, where 
required. 
The study(ies) under point 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 do not need to be 
conducted if: 
— the substance is classified as skin corrosion (Category 1), 
or 
— the substance is a strong acid (pH ≤ 2,0) or base (pH 
≥ 11,5), or 
— the substance is spontaneously flammable in air or in 
contact with water or moisture at room temperature. 
8.3.1. Skin sensitisation, in vitro/in 
chemico 
Information from in vitro/in 
chemico 
test 
method(s) 
recognised 
according 
to 
Article 
13(3), 
addressing 
each of the following key 
events of skin sensitisation: 
(a) molecular 
interaction 
with skin proteins; 
(b) inflammatory response in 
keratinocytes; 
(c) activation 
of 
dendritic 
cells. 
The(se) test(s) do not need to be conducted if: 
— an in vivo study according to point 8.3.2 is available, or 
— the available in vitro/in chemico test methods are not 
applicable for the substance or are not adequate for clas­
sification and risk assessment according to point 8.3. 
If information from test method(s) addressing one or two of 
the key events in column 1 already allows classification and 
risk assessment according to point 8.3, studies addressing the 
other key event(s) need not be conducted. 
8.3.2. Skin sensitisation, in vivo 
An in vivo study shall be conducted only if in vitro/in 
chemico test methods described under point 8.3.1 are not 
applicable, or the results obtained from those studies are 
not 
adequate 
for classification and 
risk assessment 
according to point 8.3. 
The murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) is the first- 
choice method for in vivo testing. Only in exceptional 
circumstances should another test be used. Justification for 
the use of another in vivo test shall be provided. 
In vivo skin sensitisation studies that were carried out or 
initiated before 10 
May 2017, and that meet the 
requirements set out in Article 13(3), first subparagraph,
