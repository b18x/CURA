data that no systemic absorption occurs via 
relevant routes of exposure (e.g. plasma/ 
blood concentrations below detection limit 
using a sensitive method and absence of 
the substance and of metabolites of the

If a substance is known to have an adverse

the criteria for classification in the hazard class 
reproductive toxicity (category 1A or 1B: May 
damage fertility (H360F)), and the available 
data are adequate to support a robust risk 
assessment, then no further testing for sexual 
function and fertility shall be necessary. 
If a substance is known to cause developmental 
toxicity, meeting the criteria for classification in 
the hazard class reproductive toxicity (category 
1A or 1B: May damage the unborn child

is the rat or the rabbit. The route of administra­

liquid, and inhalation if the substance is a gas; 
deviations may be made if scientifically justified, 
for example through evidence of equivalent or 
higher systemic exposure via another relevant 
route of human exposure or route-specific 
toxicity. 
8.7.2. An additional pre-natal developmental toxicity study 
in a second species, that is the other preferred 
species to the one used in the first study, shall be 
proposed by the registrant or may be required by the 
Agency if there is a concern for developmental 
toxicity based on the outcome of the first study and 
all other relevant data. That could be the case for 
example if the study on the first species shows devel­
opmental toxicity not meeting the criteria for classifi­
cation in the hazard class reproductive toxicity 
category 1A or 1B; May damage the unborn child

or reveal other concerns in relation with 
reproductive toxicity. The route of ad­

significant exposure of consumers or 
professionals, taking into account, inter 
alia, consumer exposure from articles, 
and 
(b) any of the following conditions are met: 
— the substance 
displays genotoxic 
effects in somatic cell mutagenicity 
tests in vivo which could lead to clas­

(developmental) neurotoxicity or (devel- 
opmental) immunotoxicity justified by 
any of the following: ◄ 
— existing information on the substance 
itself derived from relevant available 
in vivo or non-animal approaches (e.g. 
abnormalities of the CNS, evidence of 
adverse effects on the nervous or 
immune system in studies on adult 
animals or animals exposed prena- 
tally), or 
— specific mechanisms/modes of action 
of the substance with an association to 
(developmental) neurotoxicity and/or 
(developmental) immunotoxicity (e.g. 
cholinesterase inhibition or relevant 
changes in thyroidal hormone levels 
associated to adverse effects), or 
— existing information on effects caused 
by substances structurally analogous 
to the substance being studied, sug- 
gesting such effects or mechanisms/ 
modes of action. 
Other studies on developmental neuro-

toxicity instead of coho rts 2A /2B 
(developmental neurotoxicity) and/or co- 
hort 3 (developmental immunotoxicity) of 
the Extended One-Generation Reproduc-

the registrant in order to clarify the 
concern on developmental toxicity.
