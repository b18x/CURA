ing point 8.4.2 or in vivo mammalian gene 
mutation study regarding point 8.4.3), are 
available, 
— the substance is known to cause germ cell 
mutagenicity, meeting the criteria for 
classification as germ cell mutagen cate-

management measures are implemented, 
— the substance is known to be a genotoxic

Acute toxicity 
8.5. 
The study/ies do(es) not generally need to be 
conducted if: 
— the substance is classified as corrosive to the 
skin. 
In addition to the oral route (8.5.1.) or to the inha­
lation route (8.5.2) for nanoforms, for substances 
other than gases, the information mentioned under 
8.5.1. to 8.5.3. shall be provided for at least one 
other route. The choice for the second route will 
depend on the nature of the substance and the 
likely route of human exposure. If there is only 
one route of exposure, information for only that 
route needs to be provided. 
▼M36 
8.5.2. 
By inhalation 
8.5.2. 
Testing by the inhalation route is appropriate if 
exposure of humans via inhalation is likely taking 
into account the vapour pressure of the substance 
and/or the possibility of exposure to aerosols, 
particles or droplets of an inhalable size. 
8.5.3. 
By dermal route 
8.5.3. 
Testing by the dermal route is appropriate if: 
(1) inhalation of the substance is unlikely; and 
(2) skin contact in production and/or use is likely; 
and 
(3) the physicochemical and toxicological properties 
suggest potential for a significant rate of 
absorption through the skin. 
Testing by the dermal route does not need to be 
conducted if: 
— the substance does not meet the criteria for clas­
sification as acute toxicity or STOT SE by the 
oral route and 
— no systemic effects have been observed in in 
vivo studies with dermal exposure (e.g. skin irri­
tation, skin sensitisation) or, in the absence of an 
in vivo study by the oral route, no systemic 
effects after dermal exposure are predicted on 
the basis of non-testing approaches (e.g. read 
across, QSAR studies).

tration, having regard to 
the likely route of human 
exposure. 
8.6.1. 
The short-term toxicity study (28 days) does not 
need to be conducted if: 
►M64 — da reliable sub-chronic (90 days) or 
chronic toxicity study is available or 
proposed by the registrant, provided 
that an appropriate species, dosage, 
solvent and route of administration are 
used, or ◄ 
— where a substance undergoes immediate disinte­
gration and there are sufficient data on the 
cleavage products, or 
— relevant human exposure can be excluded in 
accordance with Annex XI Section 3. 
The appropriate route shall be chosen on the 
following basis: 
Testing by the dermal route is appropriate if: 
— inhalation of the substance is unlikely, and 
— skin contact in production and/or use is likely, 
and 
— the physicochemical and toxicological properties 
suggest potential for a significant rate of 
absorption through the skin. 
Testing by the inhalation route is appropriate if 
exposure of humans via inhalation is likely taking 
into account the vapour pressure of the substance 
and/or the possibility of exposure to aerosols, 
particles or droplets of an inhalable size. 
►M64 For nanoforms without high dissolution rate 
in biological media, the study shall include toxi­
cokinetic investigations on, among others, the 
recovery period and, where relevant, lung clearance. 
Toxicokinetic investigations do not need to be 
performed if equivalent toxicokinetic information 
on the nanoform is already available. 
The sub-chronic toxicity study (90 days) (Annex IX, 
point 8.6.2) shall be proposed by the registrant, or 
may be required by the Agency if: 
the frequency and duration of human exposure 
indicates that a longer term study is appropriate;

and one of the following conditions is met: 
— other available data indicate that the sub- 
stance may have a dangerous property that 
cannot be detected in a short-term toxicity 
study, or 
— appropriately designed toxicokinetic studies 
reveal accumulation of the substance or its 
metabolites in certain tissues or organs which 
would possibly remain undetected in a short- 
term toxicity study but which are liable to 
result in adverse effects after prolonged 
exposure. ◄ 
►M70 Further studies shall be proposed by the 
registrant or may be required by the Agency in 
case of: ◄ 
— failure to identify a NOAEL in the 28 or the 
90 days study, unless the reason for the 
failure to identify a NOAEL is absence of 
adverse toxic effects, or 
— toxicity of particular concern (e.g. serious/ 
severe effects), or 
— indications of an effect for which the avail- 
able evidence is inadequate for toxicological 
and/or risk characterisation. In such cases it 
may also be more appropriate to perform 
specific toxicological studies that are de- 
signed to investigate these effects (e.g. 
immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and in parti- 
cular for nanoforms indirect genotoxicity), or 
— the route of exposure used in the initial 
repeated dose study was inappropriate in 
relation to the expected route of human 
exposure and route-to-route extrapolation 
cannot be made, or 
— particular concern regarding exposure (e.g. 
use in consumer products leading to exposure 
levels which are close to the dose levels at 
which toxicity to humans may be expected), 
or 
— effects shown in substances with a clear 
relationship in molecular structure with the 
substance being studied, were not detected in 
the 28 or the 90 days study.
