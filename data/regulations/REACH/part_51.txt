Further studies shall be proposed by the registrant or may 
be required by the Agency in accordance with Articles 40 
or 41 in case of: 
— toxicity of particular concern (e.g. serious/severe 
effects), or 
— indications of an effect for which the available evidence 
is inadequate for toxicological evaluation and/or risk 
characterisation. In such cases it may also be more 
appropriate to perform specific toxicological studies 
that are designed to investigate these effects (e.g. 
immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity), or 
— particular concern regarding exposure (e.g. use in 
consumer products leading to exposure levels which 
are close to the dose levels at which toxicity is 
observed).

Reproductive toxicity

nogen, meeting the criteria for classification both 
in the hazard class germ cell mutagenicity 
(category 1A or 1B or 2) and carcinogenicity 
(category 1A or 1B), and appropriate risk

— the substance is known to be a germ cell 
mutagen, meeting the criteria for classification 
in the hazard class germ cell mutagenicity 
(category 1A or 1B) and appropriate risk 
management measures are implemented, or 
— the substance is of low toxicological activity (a 
comprehensive and informative dataset showing 
no toxicity seen in any of the tests available), it 
can be proven from toxicokinetic data that no 
systemic absorption occurs via relevant routes 
of exposure (e.g. plasma/blood concentrations 
below detection limit using a sensitive method 
and absence of the substance and of metabolites 
of the substance in urine, bile or exhaled air) and 
there is no or no significant human exposure. 
If a substance is known to have an adverse effect on 
sexual function and fertility, meeting the criteria for 
classification in the hazard class reproductive toxicity 
(category 1A or 1B: May damage fertility (H360F)), 
and the available data are adequate to support a 
robust risk assessment, then no further testing for 
sexual function and fertility shall be necessary. 
If a substance is known to cause developmental 
toxicity, meeting the criteria for classification in the 
hazard class reproductive toxicity (category 1A or 
1B: May damage the unborn child (H360D)), and 
the available data are adequate to support a robust 
risk assessment, then no further testing for devel­
opmental toxicity shall be necessary. ◄

of consumers or professionals, taking into account, 
inter alia, consumer exposure from articles, and 
(b) any of the following conditions are met: 
— the substance displays genotoxic effects in somatic 
cell mutagenicity tests in vivo which could lead to 
classifying it as Mutagen Category 2, or 
— there are indications that the internal dose for the 
substance and/or any of its metabolites will reach a 
steady state in the test animals only after an 
extended exposure, or

of action related to endocrine disruption from

neurotoxicity

studies 
on 
adult 
animals 
or

— specific mechanisms/modes of action of the substance 
with an association to (developmental) neurotoxicity 
and/or (developmental) immunotoxicity (e.g. cholines­
terase inhibition or relevant changes in thyroidal 
hormone levels associated to adverse effects), or 
— existing information on effects caused by substances 
structurally analogous to the substance being studied, 
suggesting such effects or mechanisms/modes of 
action.

Carcinogenicity study 
8.9.1. 
A carcinogenicity study may be proposed by the registrant 
or may be required by the Agency in accordance with 
Articles 40 or 41 if: 
— the substance has a widespread dispersive use or there 
is evidence of frequent or long-term human exposure, 
and 
►M3 — the substance is classified as germ cell mutagen 
category 2 or there is evidence from the repeated 
dose study(ies) that the substance is able to 
induce 
hyperplasia 
and/or 
pre-neoplastic 
lesions. ◄ 
►M3 If the substance is classified as germ cell mutagen 
category 1A or 1B, the default presumption would be that 
a genotoxic mechanism for carcinogenicity is likely. In 
these cases, a carcinogenicity test will normally not be 
required. ◄
