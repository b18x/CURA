By 1 June 2012 the Commission shall carry out a review to assess 
whether or not to amend the scope of this Regulation to avoid overlaps 
with other relevant Community provisions. On the basis of that review, 
the Commission may, if appropriate, present a legislative proposal.

By 1 June 2013 the Commission shall carry out a review to assess 
whether or not, taking into account latest developments in scientific 
knowledge, to extend the scope of Article 60(3) to substances identified

basis of that review the Commission may, if appropriate, present legis­
lative proposals. 
8. 
By 1 June 2019, the Commission shall carry out a review to assess 
whether or not to extend the scope of Article 33 to cover other 
dangerous substances, taking into account the practical experience in 
implementing that Article. On the basis of that review, the Commission 
may, if appropriate, present legislative proposals to extend that 
obligation.

INTRODUCTION 
▼M51 
0.1. 
The purpose of this Annex is to set out how manufacturers and 
importers are to assess and document that the risks arising from the 
substance they manufacture or import are adequately controlled during 
manufacture and their own use(s) and that others further down the 
supply chain can adequately control the risks. The chemical safety 
report shall also describe whether and which different nanoforms of 
substances as characterised in Annex VI are manufactured and 
imported, including an adequate justification for each information 
requirement describing when and how information on one form is 
used to demonstrate safety of other forms. The requirements speof the 
following hazard classes or categories setcific to nanoforms of a 
substance in this Annex apply to all nanoforms covered by the regis­
tration and without prejudice to requirements applicable to other forms 
of that substance. This Annex shall also apply adapted as necessary to 
producers and importers of articles required to make a chemical safety 
assessment as part of a registration. 
▼C1 
0.2. 
The chemical safety assessment shall be prepared by one or more 
competent person(s) who have appropriate experience and received 
appropriate training, including refresher training. 
▼M51 
0.3. 
The chemical safety assessment of a manufacturer shall address the 
manufacture of a substance and all the identified uses. The chemical 
safety assessment of an importer shall address all identified uses. The 
chemical safety assessment shall consider the use of the substance on its 
own (including any major impurities and additives), in a mixture and in 
an article, as defined by the identified uses. The assessment shall 
consider all stages of the life-cycle of the substance resulting from the 
manufacture and identified uses. The assessment shall address all 
nanoforms that are covered by the registration. The justifications and 
conclusions drawn from the assessment shall be relevant to these nano­
forms. The chemical safety assessment shall be based on a comparison 
of the potential adverse effects of a substance with the known or 
reasonably foreseeable exposure of man and/or the environment to 
that substance taking into account implemented and recommended risk 
management measures and operational conditions. 
0.4. 
Substances whose physicochemical, toxicological and eco-toxicological 
properties are likely to be similar or follow a regular pattern as a result 
of structural similarity may be considered as a group, or ‘category’ of 
substances. If the manufacturer or importer considers that the chemical 
safety assessment carried out for one substance is sufficient to assess 
and document that the risks arising from another substance or from a 
group or ‘category’ of substances are adequately controlled then he can 
use that chemical safety assessment for the other substance or group or 
‘category’ of substances. The manufacturer or importer shall provide a 
justification for this. Where any of the substances exists in one or more 
nanoforms and data from one form are used in demonstration of the safe 
use of other forms, in accordance with the general rules set out in 
Annex XI, a scientific justification shall be given on how, applying 
the rules for grouping and read-across, the data from a specific test or 
other information (e.g. methods, results or conclusions) can be used for 
the other forms of the substance. Similar considerations apply to 
exposure scenarios and risk management measures.

02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 103 
0.5. 
The chemical safety assessment shall be based on the information on the 
substance contained in the technical dossier and on other available and 
relevant information. Manufacturers or importers submitting a proposal 
for testing in accordance with Annexes IX and X shall record this under 
the relevant heading of the chemical safety report. Available information 
from assessments carried out under other international and national 
programmes shall be included. Where available and appropriate, an 
assessment carried out under Community legislation (e.g. risk 
assessments completed under Regulation (EEC) No 793/93) shall be 
taken into account in the development of, and reflected in, the 
chemical safety report. Deviations from such assessments shall be 
justified. 
Thus the information to be considered includes information related to 
the hazards of the substance, the exposure arising from the manufacture 
or import, the identified uses of the substance, operational conditions 
and risk management measures applied or recommended to downstream 
users to be taken into account. 
In accordance with section 3 of Annex XI in some cases, it may not be 
necessary to generate missing information, because risk management 
measures and operational conditions which are necessary to control a 
well-characterised risk may also be sufficient to control other potential 
risks, which will not therefore need to be characterised precisely. 
▼M51 
If the manufacturer or importer considers that further information is 
necessary for producing his chemical safety report and that this 
information can only be obtained by performing tests in accordance 
with Annex IX or X, he shall submit a proposal for a testing 
strategy, explaining why he considers that additional information is 
necessary and record this in the chemical safety report under
