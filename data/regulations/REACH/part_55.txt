3.2.2. Assessment of B or vB properties 
(a) Results from a bioconcentration or bioaccumulation study in aquatic 
species; 
(b) Other information on the bioaccumulation potential provided that its 
suitability and reliability can be reasonably demonstrated, such as: 
— Results from a bioaccumulation study in terrestrial species; 
— Data from scientific analysis of human body fluids or tissues, such 
as blood, milk, or fat; 
— Detection of elevated levels in biota, in particular in endangered 
species or in vulnerable populations, compared to levels in their 
surrounding environment; 
— Results from a chronic toxicity study on animals; 
— Assessment of the toxicokinetic behaviour of the substance; 
(c) Information on the ability of the substance to biomagnify in the food 
chain, where possible expressed by biomagnification factors or trophic 
magnification factors. 
3.2.3. Assessment of T properties 
(a) Results from long-term toxicity testing on invertebrates as set out in 
Section 9.1.5 of Annex IX; 
(b) Results from long-term toxicity testing on fish as set out in Section 
9.1.6 of Annex IX; 
(c) Results from growth inhibition study on aquatic plants as set out in in 
Section 9.1.2 of Annex VII; 
(d) The substance meeting the criteria for classification as carcinogenic in 
Category 1A or 1B (assigned hazard phrases: H350 or H350i), germ 
cell mutagenic in Category 1A or 1B (assigned hazard phrase: H340), 
toxic for reproduction in Category 1A, 1B and/or 2 (assigned hazard 
phrases: H360, H360F, H360D, H360FD, H360Fd, H360fD, H361, 
H361f, H361d or H361fd), specific target organ toxic after repeated 
dose in Category 1 or 2 (assigned hazard phrase: H372 or H373), 
according to Regulation EC No 1272/2008; 
(e) Results from long-term or reproductive toxicity testing with birds as 
set out in Section 9.6.1 of Annex X; 
(f) Other information provided that its suitability and reliability can be 
reasonably demonstrated.
