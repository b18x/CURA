Aim, scope and application 
Article 1 
Aim and scope 
1. 
The purpose of this Regulation is to ensure a high level of 
protection of human health and the environment, including the 
promotion of alternative methods for assessment of hazards of 
substances, as well as the free circulation of substances on the 
internal market while enhancing competitiveness and innovation. 
2. 
This Regulation lays down provisions on substances and 
►M3 mixtures ◄ within the meaning of Article 3. These provisions 
shall apply to the manufacture, placing on the market or use of such 
substances on their own, in ►M3 mixtures ◄ or in articles and to the 
placing on the market of ►M3 mixtures ◄. 
3. 
This Regulation is based on the principle that it is for manufac­
turers, importers and downstream users to ensure that they manufacture, 
place on the market or use such substances that do not adversely affect 
human health or the environment. Its provisions are underpinned by the 
precautionary principle.

(b) substances, on their own, in a ►M3 mixture ◄ or in an article, which 
are subject to customs supervision, provided that they do not undergo 
any treatment or processing, and which are in temporary storage, or in a 
free zone or free warehouse with a view to re-exportation, or in transit; 
(c) non-isolated intermediates; 
(d) the carriage of dangerous substances and dangerous substances in
