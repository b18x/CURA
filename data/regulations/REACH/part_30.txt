els shall be performed for all human 
populations (workers, consumers and humans liable to exposure indi­
rectly via the environment) and environmental spheres for which 
exposure to the substance is known or reasonably foreseeable. Each 
relevant route of human exposure (inhalation, oral, dermal and 
combined through all relevant routes and sources of exposure) shall be 
addressed. Such estimations shall take account of spatial and temporal 
variations in the exposure pattern. In particular, the exposure estimation 
shall take account of: 
— adequately measured, representative exposure data,

02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 113 
— any major impurities and additives in the substance, 
— the quantity in which the substance is produced and/or imported, 
— the quantity for each identified use, 
— implemented or recommended risk management, including the degree 
of containment, 
— duration and frequency of exposure according to the operational 
conditions, 
— the activities of workers related to the processes and the duration and 
frequency of their exposure to the substance, 
— the activities of consumers and the duration and frequency of their 
exposure to the substance, 
— the duration and frequency of emissions of the substance to the 
different environmental compartments and the dilution in the 
receiving environmental compartment, 
— the physicochemical properties of the substance, 
— transformation and/or degradation products, 
— the likely routes of exposure of and potential for absorption in 
humans, 
— the likely pathways to the environment and environmental distribution 
and degradation and/or transformation (see also Section 3 Step 1), 
— scale (geographical) of exposure, 
— matrix dependent release/migration of the substance. 
5.2.5. Where adequately measured representative exposure data are available, 
special consideration shall be given to them when conducting the 
exposure assessment. Appropriate models can be used for the estimation 
of exposure levels. Relevant monitoring data from substances with 
analogous use and exposure patterns or analogous properties can also 
be considered. 
6. 
RISK CHARACTERISATION 
6.1. 
The risk characterisation shall be carried out for each exposure scenario 
and shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety 
Report. 
6.2. 
The risk characterisation shall consider the human populations (exposed 
as workers, consumers or indirectly via the environment and if relevant a 
combination thereof) and the environmental spheres for which exposure 
to the substance is known or reasonably foreseeable, under the 
assumption that the risk management measures described in the 
exposure scenarios in the Section 5 have been implemented. In 
addition, the overall environmental risk caused by the substance shall 
be reviewed by integrating the results for the overall releases, 
emissions and losses from all sources to all environmental compartments. 
6.3. 
The risk characterisation consists of: 
— a comparison of the exposure of each human population known to be 
or likely to be exposed with the appropriate DNEL, 
— a comparison of the predicted environmental concentrations in each 
environmental sphere with the PNECs, and 
— an assessment of the likelihood and severity of an event occurring 
due to the physicochemical properties of the substance.

02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 114 
6.4. 
For any exposure scenario, the risk to humans and the environment can 
be considered to be adequately controlled, throughout the lifecycle of the 
substance that results from manufacture or identified uses, if: 
— the exposure levels estimated in Section 6.2 do not exceed the appro­
priate DNEL or the PNEC, as determined in Sections 1 and 3, 
respectively, and, 
— the likelihood and severity of an event occurring due to the physico­
chemical properties of the substance as determined in Section 2 is 
negligible. 
6.5. 
For those human effects and those environmental spheres for which it 
was not possible to determine a DNEL or a PNEC, a qualitative 
assessment of the likelihood that effects are avoided when implementing 
the exposure scenario shall be carried out. 
For substances satisfying the PBT and vPvB criteria, the manufacturer or 
importer shall use the information as obtained in Section 5, Step 2 when 
implementing on its site, and recommending for downstream users, risk 
management measures which minimise exposures and emissions to 
humans and the environment, throughout the lifecycle of the substance 
that results from manufacture or identified uses.

ANNEX II 
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COMPILATION OF SAFETY DATA 
SHEETS 
PART A 
0.1. 
Introduction 
0.1.1. 
This Annex sets out the requirements that the supplier shall fulfil for 
the compilation of a safety data sheet that is provided for a substance 
or a mixture in accordance with Article 31. 
0.1.2. 
The information on substances provided in the safety data sheet shall 
be consistent with the information in the registration and in the 
chemical safety report, where required. Where a chemical safety 
report has been completed, the relevant exposure scenario(s) shall 
be placed in an annex to the safety data sheet. 
0.1.3. 
The safety data sheet shall mention in each relevant section whether 
and which different nanoforms it covers and link the relevant safety 
information to each of those nanoforms. As provided for in Annex VI, 
the term ‘nanoform’ in this Annex refers to a nanoform or a set of 
similar nanoforms. 
0.2. 
General requirements for compiling a safety data sheet 
0.2.1. 
The safety data sheet shall enable users to take the necessary measures 
relating to protection of human health and safety at the workplace, 
and protection of the environment. The writer of the safety data sheet 
shall take into account that a safety data sheet must inform its 
audience of the hazards of a substance or a mixture and provide 
information on the safe storage, handling and disposal of the 
substance or the mixture. 
0.2.2. 
The information provided by safety data sheets shall also meet the 
requirements set out in Directive 98/24/EC. In particular, the safety 
data sheet shall enable employers to determine whether any hazardous 
chemical agents are present in the workplace and to assess any risk to 
the health and safety of workers arising from their use. 
0.2.3. 
The information in the safety data sheet shall be written in a clear and 
concise manner. The safety data sheet shall be prepared by a 
competent person who shall take into account the specific needs 
and knowledge of the user audience, as far as they are known. 
Suppliers of substances and mixtures shall ensure that such 
competent persons have received appropriate training, including 
refresher training. 
0.2.4. 
The language used in the safety data sheet shall be simple, clear and 
precise, avoiding jargon, acronyms and abbreviations. Statements such 
as ‘may be dangerous’, ‘no health effects’, ‘safe under most 
conditions of use’ or ‘harmless’ or any other statements indicati
