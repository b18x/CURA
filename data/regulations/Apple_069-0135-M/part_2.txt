d to increase adhesion when used in 
conjunction with a coating or adhesive system. 
Process chemical: Chemicals, used on their own or in formulations, that are not 
intentionally incorporated (partly or fully) into the product. Examples of a process 
chemical: cleaning agent, degreaser, demolder solution, lubricant, metal working 
fluid, heat transfer fluid, etching solution. Examples of a non-process chemical: 
paint, coating, ink, adhesive, primer, resin, flux, solder paste.
Processed Chlorine Free (PCF): Process by which material is produced with pulp 
from virgin and/or recycled content that has been bleached without any type of 
chlorine, or that has not been bleached at all. Recycled content may have originally 
been bleached with chlorine or chlorine derivatives.
Test Report Mapping (TRM) Form: The form used to map test reports to declared 
materials. The TRM form is created in and exported from the FMD Portal. The TRM 
form and mapped test reports are collected by Apple manufacturing partners to 
document compliance of the parts and materials used in Apple products. The 
information required to create a TRM form for Apple’s manufacturing partners is the 
foundation of an FMD declaration required by Apple. These processes have been 
harmonized to eliminate duplicative work and align requirements across the Apple 
supply chain.
Textile: A flexible material made by creating an interlocking network of yarns or 
threads, which are produced by spinning raw fibers (from either natural or synthetic 
sources) into long threads. 
Totally Chlorine Free (TCF): Process by which packaging material is produced with 
pulp from virgin content that has been bleached without any type of chlorine, or that 
has not been bleached at all.
Varnish: Transparent coating material. 
Wearable products: Electronics or accessories that can be comfortably worn on the 
body, such as Apple Watch. These products will occlude the skin.

3. Restricted Substances in Products
Restrictions in Section 3 apply to all homogeneous materials used in Apple products, accessories, and packaging. Restrictions also apply to all homogeneous materials applied to or 
cured onto parts in Apple products, accessories, and packaging. This includes adhesives, inks, coatings, primers, and other wet formulations manufactured by the material manufacturer 
in addition to the cured materials in the finished good. In certain cases, the scope may be more limited, which is indicated in the table below. Otherwise, if “All materials” is indicated in 
the scope, the general restriction scope applies. Substances and their respective restrictions are listed in alphabetical order.
