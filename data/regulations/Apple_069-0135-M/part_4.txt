4. Reportable Substances and Future Restrictions in Products
Suppliers are required to report the use of all substances listed in Section 4, regardless of the future restriction timeline, in any homogeneous materials used in Apple products, 
accessories, and packaging as well as in any homogeneous materials applied to or cured onto parts in Apple products, accessories, and packaging. This includes the wet 
formulations of adhesives, inks, coatings, primers, and other wet formulations manufactured by the material manufacturer in addition to the cured materials in the finished good. 
In some cases, reporting is required only if the substances exceed a defined permissible limit. Apple is prioritizing the chemicals it intends to restrict in the future in order to 
work effectively with its supply chain. Suppliers are required to report via FMD Portal and/or the Test Report Mapping (TRM) form for evaluation and approval for use prior to use 
in Apple products. Where indicated, Apple expects future restrictions based on regulation or Apple Policy. Some substances will require immediate phase-out; suppliers must start 
reformulating existing or qualifying new materials that do not intentionally use the substance(s). In some cases, use will be allowed under a specific threshold limit.
