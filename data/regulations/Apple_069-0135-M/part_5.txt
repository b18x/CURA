5. Notifying Apple of Chemical Phase Out and Reformulation from Suppliers
Suppliers are required to communicate promptly any change in chemical manufacturing processes, manufacturing site, or any other change that will affect any attribute of the material 
either in its chemical composition (intentional or residual) or its lead time. For example, if for environmental or other purposes the supplier wishes to modify the goods or the processes, 
production lines, or site(s) used to manufacture the parts or finished goods, the supplier must provide Apple with the reason (e.g., an internal initiative to a phase out or to reformulate 
any material/part due to a chemical or any other concern), by contacting the supplier’s Apple Global Supply Manager(s) and the Apple Environmental Team at environment@apple.com 
prior to any such modification. Apple will review the submission and decide whether, or to what extent, a modification is permitted. For any such modification, the supplier must, at
a minimum, provide test reports to meet the requirements of Section 9 and test reports for other substances may also be requested. Subject to the above, suppliers must agree to 
not modify the goods or the processes used to manufacture the goods in any way after qualification without Apple’s prior written consent.
6. Restrictions in Manufacturing Processes
Restrictions in Section 6 apply to manufacturing process chemicals used to create components or materials for Apple products and the assembly of Apple products including: 
direct use during production or indirect use for manufacturing equipment, machines, or tools during maintenance. Restrictions do not apply to laboratory, housekeeping, 
wastewater treatment plant, or other non-manufacturing processes. Suppliers must comply with threshold limits for the chemicals listed in this section. Test reports are required to 
demonstrate compliance of non-use. “Non-use” and “no intentional use” are defined in Section 2. Per the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct, suppliers shall identify, evaluate, and 
manage occupational health and safety hazards through a prioritized process of hazard elimination, engineering controls, and/or administrative controls. Suppliers shall provide 
their employees with suitable job-related, appropriately maintained personal protective equipment and instruction on its proper use.

7. Reportable Substances and Future Restrictions in Manufacturing Processes
Suppliers are required to report the use of substances listed in Section 7 in any manufacturing process used to create components or materials for Apple products regardless of phase 
out priority. Apple is prioritizing the chemicals it intends to phase out of Apple manufacturing processes in order to work effectively with its supply chain. Suppliers are required to report 
use through the Chemical Safety Disclosure Portal. Apple may require disclosure of the use of manufacturing process chemicals and their chemical composition as deemed necessary.

8. Supplementary Specifications
All Apple products must comply with the restrictions listed in this Regulated 
Substances Specification. In cases when new restrictions are introduced over 
a transition period, Apple may release supplementary specifications referencing 
those specific restrictions. Drawings, fabrication notes, and product specifications 
will reference the supplementary specification as applicable. The supplementary 
specifications are available to qualified suppliers upon request by contacting 
Apple at environment@apple.com.
8.1 Apple Environmental Quality Specification, 069-8496
The Apple Environmental Quality Specification sets forth Apple’s requirements for 
final assembly facilities, module suppliers, and component suppliers to maintain 
an environmental quality control program to ensure the environmental compliance
of Apple products. The environmental quality control program for supplier facilities 
must include a material declaration process, in-process controls, and audits of raw 
materials and finished goods. All final assembly and module suppliers are required 
to adhere to these requirements and provide information to Apple in a timely manner. 
8.2 Apple Regulated Substances Specification for Prolonged Skin 
Contact Materials, 099-3470
The Apple Regulated Substances Specification for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials  
applies to materials with direct or indirect prolonged skin contact in both wearable 
and non-wearable products. Materials with no or incidental skin contact will not 
need to comply with this specification. All materials, regardless of whether they are 
in prolonged skin contact, must also comply with the Apple Regulated Substances 
Specification (069-0135). 
8.3 Conflict Minerals Restrictions, 069-5202 
All suppliers of materials, parts, sub-components, components, or products 
(Component Goods) that are to be incorporated into an Apple product and 
containing tantalum, tungsten, tin, gold, or cobalt must comply with the specification 
on Conflict Minerals Restrictions, 069-5202. Suppliers may only use tin, tantalum, 
tungsten, gold, or cobalt in Component Goods if the supplier demonstrates that it 
has exercised due diligence in the sourcing of such materials and reports to Apple 
on the source and chain of custody of such metals in accordance with the OECD 
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-
Affected and High-Risk Areas. This will enable a determination as to whether those 
metals are from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or any adjoining 
country and, if so,
whether those metals directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups that 
are perpetrators of serious human rights abuses in the DRC or an adjoining country. 
Suppliers may only source tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold, or cobalt through smel
