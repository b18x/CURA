CHAPTER 1 
Aim, scope and application 
Article 1 
Aim and scope 
1. 
The purpose of this Regulation is to ensure a high level of 
protection of human health and the environment, including the 
promotion of alternative methods for assessment of hazards of 
substances, as well as the free circulation of substances on the 
internal market while enhancing competitiveness and innovation. 
2. 
This Regulation lays down provisions on substances and 
►M3 mixtures ◄ within the meaning of Article 3. These provisions 
shall apply to the manufacture, placing on the market or use of such 
substances on their own, in ►M3 mixtures ◄ or in articles and to the 
placing on the market of ►M3 mixtures ◄. 
3. 
This Regulation is based on the principle that it is for manufac­
turers, importers and downstream users to ensure that they manufacture, 
place on the market or use such substances that do not adversely affect 
human health or the environment. Its provisions are underpinned by the 
precautionary principle. 
Article 2 
Application 
1. 
This Regulation shall not apply to: 
(a) radioactive substances within the scope of Council Directive 
96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 laying down basic safety 
standards for the protection of the health of workers and the 
general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation ( 1 ); 
(b) substances, on their own, in a ►M3 mixture ◄ or in an article, which 
are subject to customs supervision, provided that they do not undergo 
any treatment or processing, and which are in temporary storage, or in a 
free zone or free warehouse with a view to re-exportation, or in transit; 
(c) non-isolated intermediates; 
(d) the carriage of dangerous substances and dangerous substances in 
dangerous ►M3 mixtures ◄ by rail, road, inland waterway, sea or 
air. 
2. 
Waste as defined in Directive 2006/12/EC of the European 
Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ) is not a substance, ►M3 mixture ◄

3. 
Member States may allow for exemptions from this Regulation in 
specific cases for certain substances, on their own, in a ►M3 mixture ◄ 
or in an article, where necessary in the interests of defence. 
4. 
This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to: 
(a) Community workplace and environmental legislation, including 
Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction 
of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of 
workers at work ( 1 ), Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 
1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control ( 2 ); 
Directive 98/24/EC, Directive 2000/60/EC of the European

Directive 2004/37/EC; 
(b) Directive 76/768/EEC as regards testing involving vertebrate 
animals within the scope of that Directive. 
5. 
The provisions of Titles II, V, VI and VII shall not apply to the 
extent that a substance is used: 
(a) in medicinal products for human or veterinary use within the scope 
of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, Directive 2001/82/EC of the 
European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on 
the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products ( 4 ) 
and Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the 
Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to 
medicinal products for human use ( 5 ); 
(b) in food or feedingstuffs in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 
178/2002 including use: 
(i) as a food additive in foodstuffs within the scope of Council

Article 13 
General requirements for generation of information on intrinsic 
properties of substances 
1. 
Information on intrinsic properties of substances may be generated 
by means other than tests, provided that the conditions set out in Annex 
XI are met. In particular for human toxicity, information shall be 
generated whenever possible by means other than vertebrate animal 
tests, through the use of alternative methods, for example, in vitro 
methods or qualitative or quantitative structure-activity relationship 
models or from information from structurally related substances 
(grouping or read-across). Testing in accordance with Annex VIII, 
Sections 8.6 and 8.7, Annex IX and Annex X may be omitted where 
justified by information on exposure and implemented risk management 
measures as specified in Annex XI, section 3. 
2. 
These methods shall be regularly reviewed and improved with a 
view to reducing testing on vertebrate animals and the number of 
animals involved. The Commission, following consultation with 
relevant stakeholders, shall, as soon as possible, make a proposal, if 
appropriate, to amend the Commission Regulation on test methods 
adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 133(4), 
and the Annexes of this Regulation, if relevant, so as to replace, reduce 
or refine animal testing. Amendments to that Commission Regulation 
shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure specified in 
paragraph 3 and amendments to the Annexes of this Regulation shall 
be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 131. 
3. 
Where tests on substances are required to generate information on 
intrinsic properties of substances, they shall be conducted in accordance 
with the test methods laid down in a Commission Regulation or in 
accordance with other international test methods recognised by the 
Commission or the Agency as being appropriate. The Commission 
shall adopt that Regulation, designed to amend the non-essential 
elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, in accordance with 
the procedure referred to in Article 133(4). 
Information on intrinsic properties of substances may be generated in 
accordance with other test methods provided that the conditions set out 
in Annex XI are met. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 23 
4. 
Ecotoxicological and toxicological tests and analyses shall be 
carried out in compliance with the principles of good laboratory 
practice provided for in Directive 2004/10/EC or other international 
standards recognised as being equivalent by the Commission or the 
Agency and with the provisions of Directive 86/609/EEC, if applicable. 
5. 
If a substance has already been registered, a new registrant shall 
be entitled to refer to the study summaries or robust study summaries, 
for the same substance submitted earlier, provided that he can show that 
the substance that he is now registering is the same as the one 
previously registered, including the degree of purity and the nature of 
impurities, and that the previous registrant(s) have given permission to 
refer to the full study reports for the purpose of registration. 
A new registrant shall not refer to such studies in order to provide the 
information required in Section 2 of Annex VI. 
Article 14 
Chemical safety report and duty to apply and recommend risk 
reduction measures 
1. 
Without prejudice to Article 4 of Directive 98/24/EC, a chemical 
safety assessment shall be performed and a chemical safety report 
completed for all substances subject to registration in accordance with 
this Chapter in quantities of 10 tonnes or more per year per registrant. 
The chemical safety report shall document the chemical safety 
assessment which shall be conducted in accordance with paragraphs 2 
to 7 and with Annex I for either each substance on its own or in a 
►M3 mixture ◄ or in an article or a group of substances. 
▼M3 
2. 
A chemical safety assessment in accordance with paragraph 1 need 
not be performed for a substance which is present in a mixture if the 
concentration of the substance in the mixture is less than: 
(a) the cut-off value referred to in Article 11, paragraph 3 of Regulation 
(EC) No 1272/2008; 
(b) 0,1 % weight by weight (w/w), if the substance meets the criteria in 
Annex XIII to this Regulation.

(d) hazard class 5.1, 
or is assessed to be a PBT or vPvB, the chemical safety assessment 
shall include the following additional steps: 
▼C1 
(a) exposure assessment including the generation of exposure scen­
ario(s) (or the identification of relevant use and exposure categories 
if appropriate) and exposure estimation; 
(b) risk characterisation. 
The exposure scenarios (where appropriate the use and exposure 
categories), exposure assessment and risk characterisation shall 
address all identified uses of the registrant. 
5. 
The chemical safety report need not include consideration of the 
risks to human health from the following end uses: 
(a) in food contact materials within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 
1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 
27 October 2004 on materials and articles intended to come into 
contact with food ( 1 ); 
(b) in cosmetic products within the scope of Directive 76/768/EEC.

three months from that deadline, without prejudice to Article 27(8). 
In the case of an update of a registration according to Article 22 a 
registrant may continue the manufacture or import of the substance, or 
the production or import of the article, if there is no indication to the 
contrary from the Agency in accordance with Article 20(2) within the 
three weeks after the update date, without prejudice to Article 27(8). 
2. 
If the Agency has informed the registrant that he is to submit 
further information in accordance with the third subparagraph of 
Article 20(2), the registrant may start the manufacture or import of a 
substance or production or import of an article if there is no indication 
to the contrary from the Agency within the three weeks after receipt by 
the Agency of the further information necessary to complete his regis­
tration, without prejudice to Article 27(8). 
3. 
If a lead registrant submits parts of the registration on behalf of 
one or more other registrants, as provided for in Articles 11 or 19, any 
of the other registrants may manufacture or import the substance or 
produce or import the articles only after the expiry of the time-limit 
laid down in paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article and provided that there is 
no indication to the contrary from the Agency in respect of the regis­
tration of the lead registrant acting on behalf of the others and his own 
registration. 
Article 22

TITLE III 
DATA SHARING AND AVOIDANCE OF UNNECESSARY TESTING 
CHAPTER 1 
Objectives and general rules 
Article 25 
Objectives and general rules 
1. 
In order to avoid animal testing, testing on vertebrate animals for 
the purposes of this Regulation shall be undertaken only as a last resort. 
It is also necessary to take measures limiting duplication of other tests. 
2. 
The sharing and joint submission of information in accordance 
with this Regulation shall concern technical data and in particular 
information related to the intrinsic properties of substances. Registrants 
shall refrain from exchanging information concerning their market 
behaviour, in particular as regards production capacities, production or 
sales volumes, import volumes or market shares. 
3. 
Any study summaries or robust study summaries of studies 
submitted in the framework of a registration under this Regulation at 
least 12 years previously can be used for the purposes of registration by 
another manufacturer or importer. 
CHAPTER 2 
Rules for non-phase-in substances and registrants of phase-in 
substances who have not pre-registered 
Article 26 
Duty to inquire prior to registration 
1. 
Every potential registrant of a non-phase-in substance, or potential 
registrant of a phase-in substance who has not pre-registered in 
accordance with Article 28, shall inquire from the Agency whether a 
registration has already been submitted for the same substance. He shall 
submit all the following information to the Agency with the inquiry: 
(a) his identity as specified in Section 1 of Annex VI, with the 
exception of the use sites; 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 35 
(b) the identity of the substance, as specified in Section 2 of Annex VI; 
(c) which information requirements would require new studies 
involving vertebrate animals to be carried out by him; 
(d) which information requirements would require other new studies to 
be carried out by him. 
2. 
If the same substance has previously not been registered, the 
Agency shall inform the potential registrant accordingly. 
3. 
If the same substance has previously been registered less than 12 
years earlier, the Agency shall inform the potential registrant without 
delay of the names and addresses of the previous registrant(s) and of the 
relevant summaries or robust study summaries, as the case may be, 
already submitted by them. 
Studies involving vertebrate animals shall not be repeated. 
The Agency shall simultaneously inform the previous registrants of the 
name and address of the potential registrant. The available studies shall 
be shared with the potential registrant in accordance with Article 27. 
4. 
If several potential registrants have made an inquiry in respect of 
the same substance, the Agency shall inform all potential registrants 
without delay of the name and address of the other potential registrants. 
Article 27 
Sharing of existing data in the case of registered substances 
1. 
Where a substance has previously been registered less than 12 
years earlier as referred to in Article 26(3), the potential registrant: 
(a) shall, in the case of information involving tests on vertebrate 
animals; and 
(b) may, in the case of information not involving tests on vertebrate 
animals, 
request from the previous registrant(s) the information he requires with 
respect to Article 10(a)(vi) and (vii) in order to register. 
2. 
When a request for information has been made according to 
paragraph 1, the potential and the previous registrant(s) as referred to 
in paragraph 1 shall make every effort to reach an agreement on the 
sharing of the information requested by the potential registrant(s) with 
respect to Article 10(a)(vi) and (vii). Such an agreement may be 
replaced by submission of the matter to an arbitration board and 
acceptance of the arbitration order. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 36 
3. 
The previous registrant and potential registrant(s) shall make every 
effort to ensure that the costs of sharing the information are determined 
in a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory way. This may be 
facilitated by following cost sharing guidance based on those principles 
which is adopted by the Agency in accordance with Article 77(2)(g). 
Registrants are only required to share in the costs of information that 
they are required to submit to satisfy their registration requirements. 
4. 
On agreement on the sharing of the information, the previous 
registrant shall make available to the new registrant the agreed 
information and shall give the new registrant the permission to refer 
to the previous registrant's full study report. 
5. 
If there is failure to reach such an agreement, the potential regis­
trant(s) shall inform the Agency and the previous registrant(s) thereof at 
the earliest one month after receipt, from the Agency, of the name and 
address of the previous registrant(s). 
6. 
Within one month from the receipt of the information referred to 
in paragraph 5, the Agency shall give the potential registrant permission 
to refer to the information requested by him in his registration dossier, 
subject to the potential registrant providing, upon request by the 
Agency, proof that he has paid the previous registrant(s) for that 
information a share of cost incurred. The previous registrant(s) shall 
have a claim on the potential registrant for a proportionate share of 
the cost incurred by him. Calculation of the proportionate share may 
be facilitated by the guidance adopted by the Agency in accordance 
with Article 77(2)(g). Provided he makes the full study report 
available to the potential registrant, the previous registrant(s) shall 
have a claim on the potential registrant for an equal share of the cost 
incurred by him, which shall be enforceable in the national courts. 
7. 
An appeal may be brought, in accordance with Articles 91, 92 and 
93, against Agency decisions under paragraph 6 of this Article. 
8. 
The registration waiting period in accordance with Article 21(1) 
for the new registrant shall be extended by a period of four months, if 
the previous registrant so requests. 
CHAPTER 3 
Rules for phase-in-substances 
Article 28 
Duty to pre-register for phase-in substances 
1. 
In order to benefit from the transitional regime provided for in 
Article 23 each potential registrant of a phase-in substance in quantities 
of one tonne or more per year, including without limitation inter­
mediates, shall submit all the following information to the Agency: 
(a) the name of the substance as specified in Section 2 of Annex VI, 
including its EINECS and CAS number or, if not available, any 
other identity codes; 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 37 
(b) his name and address and the name of the contact person and, 
where appropriate, the name and address of the person representing 
him in accordance with Article 4 as specified in Section 1 of 
Annex VI; 
(c) the envisaged deadline for the registration and the tonnage band; 
(d) the name(s) of substance(s) as specified in Section 2 of Annex VI,

other identity codes, for which the available information is relevant 
for the application of Sections 1.3 and 1.5 of Annex XI. 
2. 
The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall be submitted 
within a time period starting on 1 June 2008 and ending on 
1 December 2008. 
3. 
Registrants who do not submit the information required under 
paragraph 1 shall not be able to rely on Article 23. 
4. 
The Agency shall by 1 January 2009 publish on its website a list 
of the substances referred to in paragraph 1(a) and (d). That list shall 
comprise only the names of the substances, including their EINECS and 
CAS number if available and other identity codes, and the first 
envisaged registration deadline. 
5. 
After the publication of the list a downstream user of a substance 
not appearing on the list may notify the Agency of his interest in the 
substance, his contact details and the details of his current supplier. The 
Agency shall publish on its website the name of the substance and on 
request provide contact details of the downstream user to a potential 
registrant. 
6. 
Potential registrants who manufacture or import for the first time a 
phase-in substance in quantities of one tonne or more per year or use for 
the first time a phase-in substance in the context of production of 
articles or import for the first time an article containing a phase-in 
substance that would require registration, after 1 December 2008, 
shall be entitled to rely on Article 23 provided that they submit the 
information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to the Agency 
within six months of first manufacturing, importing or using the 
substance in quantities of one tonne or more per year and no later 
than 12 months before the relevant deadline in Article 23. 
7. 
Manufacturers or importers of phase-in substances in quantities of 
less than one tonne per year that appear on the list published by the 
Agency in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article, as well as 
downstream users of those substances and third parties holding 
information on those substances, may submit the information referred 
to in paragraph 1 of this Article or any other relevant information to the 
Agency for those substances, with the intention of being part of the 
substance information exchange forum as referred to in Article 29. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 38 
Article 29 
Substance Information Exchange Forums 
1. 
All potential registrants, downstream users and third parties who 
have submitted information to the Agency in accordance with Article 28, 
or whose information is held by the Agency in accordance with 
Article 15, for the same phase-in substance, or registrants who have 
submitted a registration for that phase-in substance before the deadline 
set out in Article 23(3), shall be participants in a substance information 
exchange forum (SIEF). 
2. 
The aim of each SIEF shall be to: 
(a) facilitate, for the purposes of registration, the exchange of the 
information specified in Article 10(a) (vi) and (vii) between 
potential registrants, thereby avoiding the duplication of studies; and 
(b) agree classification and labelling where there is a difference in the 
classification and labelling of the substance between potential regis­
trants. 
3. 
SIEF participants shall provide other participants with existing 
studies, react to requests by other participants for information, collec­
tively identify needs for further studies for the purposes of paragraph 
2(a) and arrange for such studies to be carried out. Each SIEF shall be 
operational until 1 June 2018. 
Article 30 
Sharing of data involving tests 
1. 
Before testing is carried out in order to meet the information 
requirements for the purposes of registration, a SIEF participant shall 
inquire whether a relevant study is available by communicating within 
his SIEF. If a relevant study involving tests on vertebrate animals is 
available within the SIEF, a participant of that SIEF shall request that 
study. If a relevant study not involving tests on vertebrate animals is 
available within the SIEF, a SIEF participant may request that study. 
Within one month of the request, the owner of the study shall provide 
proof of its cost to the participant(s) requesting it. The participant(s) and 
the owner shall make every effort to ensure that the costs of sharing the 
information are determined in a fair, transparent and non discriminatory 
way. This may be facilitated by following any cost sharing guidance 
which is based on those principles and is adopted by the Agency in 
accordance with Article 77(2)(g). If they cannot reach such an 
agreement, the cost shall be shared equally. The owner shall give 
permission to refer to the full study report for the purpose of registration 
within two weeks of receipt of payment. Registrants are only required to 
share in the costs of information that they are required to submit to 
satisfy their registration requirements. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 39 
2. 
If a relevant study involving tests is not available within the SIEF, 
only one study shall be conducted per information requirement within 
each SIEF by one of its participants acting on behalf of the others. They 
shall take all reasonable steps to reach an agreement within a deadline 
set by the Agency as to who is to carry out the test on behalf of the 
other participants and to submit a summary or robust study summary to 
the Agency. If no agreement is reached, the Agency shall specify which 
registrant or downstream user shall perform the test. All participants of 
the SIEF who require a study shall contribute to the costs for the 
elaboration of the study with a share corresponding to the number of 
participating potential registrants. Those participants that do not carry 
out the study themselves shall have the right to receive the full study 
report within two weeks following payment to the participant that 
carried out the study. 
3. 
If the owner of a study as referred to in paragraph 1 which 
involves testing on vertebrate animals refuses to provide either proof 
of the cost of that study or the study itself to (an) other participant(s), he 
shall not be able to proceed with registration until he provides the 
information to the other participants(s). The other participant(s) shall 
proceed with registration without fulfilling the relevant information 
requirement, explaining the reason for this in the registration dossier. 
The study shall not be repeated unless within 12 months of the date of 
registration of the other participant(s), the owner of this information has 
not provided it to them and the Agency decides that the test should be 
repeated by them. However, if a registration containing this information 
has already been submitted by another registrant, the Agency shall give 
the other participant(s) permission to refer to the information in his 
registration dossier(s). The other registrant shall have a claim on the 
other participant(s) for an equal share of the cost, provided he makes the 
full study report available to the other participant(s), which shall be 
enforceable in the national courts. 
4. 
If the owner of a study as referred to in paragraph 1 which does 
not involve testing on vertebrate animals refuses to provide either proof 
of the cost of that study or the study itself to (an)other participant(s), the 
other SIEF participants shall proceed with registration as if no relevant 
study was available in the SIEF. 
5. 
An appeal may be brought, in accordance with Articles 91, 92 and 
93, against Agency decisions under paragraphs 2 or 3 of this Article. 
6. 
The owner of the study who has refused to provide either proof of 
the cost or the study itself, as referred to in paragraph 3 or 4 of this 
Article, shall be penalised in accordance with Article 126.

CHAPTER 2 
Substance evaluation 
Article 44 
Criteria for substance evaluation 
1. 
In order to ensure a harmonised approach, the Agency shall in 
cooperation with the Member States develop criteria for prioritising 
substances with a view to further evaluation. Prioritisation shall be on 
a risk-based approach. The criteria shall consider: 
(a) hazard information, for instance structural similarity of the 
substance with known substances of concern or with substances 
which are persistent and liable to bio-accumulate, suggesting that 
the substance or one or more of its transformation products has 
properties of concern or is persistent and liable to bio-accumulate; 
(b) exposure information; 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 51 
(c) tonnage, including aggregated tonnage from the registrations 
submitted by several registrants. 
2. 
The Agency shall use the criteria in paragraph 1 for the purpose of 
compiling a draft Community rolling action plan which shall cover a 
period of three years and shall specify substances to be evaluated each 
year. Substances shall be included if there are grounds for considering 
(either on the basis of a dossier evaluation carried out by the Agency or 
on the basis of any other appropriate source, including information in 
the registration dossier) that a given substance constitutes a risk to 
human health or the environment. The Agency shall submit the first 
draft rolling action plan to the Member States by 1 December 2011. The 
Agency shall submit draft annual updates to the rolling action plan to 
the Member States by 28 February each year. 
The Agency shall adopt the final Community rolling action plan on the 
basis of an opinion from the Member State Committee set up under 
Article 76(1)(e) (hereinafter referred to as the Member State Committee) 
and shall publish the plan on its website, identifying the Member State 
who will carry out the evaluation of the substances listed therein as 
determined according to Article 45. 
Article 45 
Competent authority 
1. 
The Agency shall be responsible for coordinating the substance 
evaluation process and ensuring that substances on the Community 
rolling action plan are evaluated. In doing so, the Agency shall rely 
on the competent authorities of Member States. In carrying out an 
evaluation of a substance, the competent authorities may appoint 
another body to act on their behalf. 
2. 
A Member State may choose (a) substance(s) from the draft 
Community rolling action plan, with the aim of becoming a 
competent authority for the purposes of Articles 46, 47 and 48. In the 
event of a substance from the draft Community rolling action plan not 
being chosen by any Member State, the Agency shall ensure that the 
substance is evaluated. 
3. 
In cases where two or more Member States have expressed an 
interest in evaluating the same substance and they cannot agree who 
should be the competent authority, the competent authority for the 
purposes of Articles 46, 47 and 48 shall be determined in accordance 
with the following procedure. 
The Agency shall refer the matter to the Member State Committee, in 
order to agree which authority shall be the competent authority, taking 
into account the Member State in which the manufacturer(s) or 
importer(s) is located, the respective proportions of total Community 
gross domestic product, the number of substances already being 
evaluated by a Member State and the expertise available. 
If, within 60 days of the referral, the Member State Committee reaches 
unanimous agreement, the Member States concerned shall adopt 
substances for evaluation accordingly. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 52 
If the Member State Committee fails to reach a unanimous agreement, 
the Agency shall submit the conflicting opinions to the Commission, 
which shall decide which authority shall be the competent authority, in 
accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 133(3), and the 
Member States concerned shall adopt substances for evaluation accord­
ingly. 
4. 
The competent authority identified in accordance with paragraphs 
2 and 3 shall evaluate the allocated substances in accordance with this 
Chapter. 
5. 
A Member State may notify the Agency at any time of a substance 
not on the Community rolling action plan, whenever it is in possession 
of information which suggests that the substance is a priority for evalu­
ation. The Agency shall decide whether to add this substance to the 
Community rolling action plan on the basis of an opinion from the 
Member State Committee. If the substance is added to the 
Community rolling action plan, the proposing Member State, or 
another Member State who agrees, shall evaluate that substance. 
Article 46 
Requests for further information and check of information 
submitted 
1. 
If the competent authority considers that further information is 
required, including, if appropriate, information not required in 
Annexes VII to X, it shall prepare a draft decision, stating reasons, 
requiring the registrant(s) to submit the further information and setting 
a deadline for its submission. A draft decision shall be prepared within 
12 months of the publication of the Community rolling action plan on 
the Agency's website for substances to be evaluated that year. The 
decision shall be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in 
Articles 50 and 52. 
2. 
The registrant shall submit the information required to the Agency 
by the deadline set. 
3. 
The competent authority shall examine any information submitted, 
and shall draft any appropriate decisions in accordance with this Article, 
if necessary, within 12 months of the information being submitted. 
4. 
The competent authority shall finish its evaluation activities within 
12 months of the start of the evaluation of the substance or within 12 
months of the information being submitted under paragraph 2, and 
notify the Agency accordingly. If this deadline is exceeded, the 
evaluation shall be deemed to be finished. 
Article 47 
Coherence with other activities 
1. 
An evaluation of a substance shall be based on all relevant 
information submitted on that particular substance and on any 
previous evaluation under this Title. Where information on intrinsic 
properties of a substance has been generated by reference to structurally 
related substance(s), the evaluation may also cover these related 
substances. In cases where a decision on an evaluation has been 
previously taken in accordance with Article 51 or Article 52, any 
draft decision requiring further information under Article 46 may be 
justified only by a change of circumstances or acquired knowledge. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 53 
2. 
In order to ensure a harmonised approach to requests for further 
information, the Agency shall monitor draft decisions under Article 46 
and shall develop criteria and priorities. Where appropriate, implemen­
ting measures shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure 
referred to in Article 133(3). 
Article 48 
Follow-up to substance evaluation 
Once the substance evaluation has been completed, the competent 
authority shall consider how to use the information obtained from this 
evaluation for the purposes of Article 59(3), Article 69(4) and 
Article 115(1). The competent authority shall inform the Agency of 
its conclusions as to whether or how to use the information obtained. 
The Agency shall in turn inform the Commission, the registrant and the 
competent authorities of the other Member States. 
CHAPTER 3 
Evaluation of intermediates 
Article 49 
Further information on on-site isolated intermediates 
For on-site isolated intermediates that are used in strictly controlled 
conditions, neither dossier nor substance evaluation shall apply. 
However, where the competent authority of the Member State in 
whose territory the site is located considers that a risk to human 
health or the environment, equivalent to the level of concern arising 
from the use of substances meeting the criteria in Article 57, arises from 
the use of an on-site isolated intermediate and that risk is not properly 
controlled, it may: 
(a) require the registrant to submit further information directly related 
to the risk identified. This request shall be accompanied by a written 
justification; 
(b) examine any information submitted and, if necessary, recommend 
any appropriate risk reduction measures to address the risks 
identified in relation to the site in question. 
The procedure provided for in the first paragraph may be undertaken 
only by the competent authority referred to therein. The competent 
authority shall inform the Agency of the results of such an evaluation, 
which shall then inform the competent authorities of the other Member 
States and make the results available to them.

The Agency shall notify any draft decision under Articles 40, 41 
or 46 to the registrant(s) or downstream user(s) concerned, informing 
them of their right to comment within 30 days of receipt. If the 
concerned registrant(s) or downstream user(s) wish to comment, they 
shall provide their comments to the Agency. The Agency in turn shall 
inform the competent authority of the submission of the comments 
without delay. The competent authority (for decisions taken under 
Article 46) and the Agency (for decisions taken under Articles 40 and 
41) shall take any comments received into account and may amend the 
draft decision accordingly. 
2. 
If a registrant has ceased the manufacture or import of the 
substance, or the production or import of an article, or the downstream 
user the use, he shall inform the Agency of this fact with the 
consequence that the registered volume in his registration, if appro­
priate, shall be put to zero and no further information may be 
requested with respect to that substance, unless the registrant notifies 
the restart of the manufacture or import of the substance or the 
production or import of the article, or the downstream user notifies 
the restart of the use. The Agency shall inform the competent 
authority of the Member State in which the registrant or downstream 
user is located. 
3. 
The registrant may cease the manufacture or import of the 
substance or the production or import of the article, or the downstream 
user the use, upon receipt of the draft decision. In such cases, the 
registrant, or downstream user, shall inform the Agency of this fact 
with the consequence that his registration, or report, shall no longer 
be valid, and no further information may be requested with respect to 
that substance, unless he submits a new registration or report. The 
Agency shall inform the competent authority of the Member State in 
which the registrant or downstream user is located. 
4. 
Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3, further information may be 
required in accordance with Article 46 in either or both of the following 
cases: 
(a) where the competent authority prepares a dossier in accordance with 
Annex XV concluding that there is a potential long-term risk to 
human health or the environment justifying the need for further 
information; 
(b) where the exposure to the substance manufactured or imported by 
the registrant(s), or to the substance in the article produced or 
imported by the registrant(s), or to the substance used by the down­
stream user(s) contributes significantly to that risk. 
The procedure in Articles 69 to 73 shall apply mutatis mutandis.

93, against Agency decisions under paragraphs 3 and 6 of this Article. 
Article 52 
Adoption of decisions under substance evaluation 
1. 
The competent authority shall circulate its draft decision in 
accordance with Article 46, together with any comments by the 
registrant or downstream user, to the Agency and to the competent 
authorities of the other Member States. 
2. 
The provisions of Article 51(2) to (8) shall apply mutatis 
mutandis. 
Article 53 
Cost sharing for tests without an agreement between registrants 
and/or downstream users 
1. 
Where registrants or downstream users are required to perform a 
test as a result of a decision taken under this Title, those registrants or 
downstream users shall make every effort to reach an agreement as to 
who is to carry it out on behalf of the other registrants or downstream 
users and to inform the Agency accordingly within 90 days. If the 
Agency is not informed of such agreement within such 90 days, it 
shall designate one of the registrants or downstream users to perform 
the test on behalf of all of them. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 56 
2. 
If a registrant or downstream user performs a test on behalf of 
others, they shall all share the cost of that study equally. 
3. 
In the case referred to in paragraph 1, the registrant or downstream 
user who performs the test shall provide each of the others concerned 
with a copy of the full study report. 
4. 
The person performing and submitting the study shall have a claim 
against the others accordingly. Any person concerned shall be able to 
make a claim in order to prohibit another person from manufacturing, 
importing or placing the substance on the market if that other person 
either fails to pay his share of the cost or to provide security for that 
amount or fails to hand over a copy of the full study report of the study 
performed. All claims shall be enforceable in the national courts. Any 
person may choose to submit their claims for remuneration to an 
arbitration board and accept the arbitration order. 
Article 54 
Publication of information on evaluation 
By 28 February of each year, the Agency shall publish on its website a 
report on the progress made over the previous calendar year towards 
discharging the obligations incumbent upon it in relation to evaluation. 
This report shall include, in particular, recommendations to potential 
registrants in order to improve the quality of future registrations. 
TITLE VII 
AUTHORISATION 
CHAPTER 1 
Authorisation requirement 
Article 55 
Aim of authorisation and considerations for substitution 
The aim of this Title is to ensure the good functioning of the internal 
market while assuring that the risks from substances of very high 
concern are properly controlled and that these substances are 
progressively replaced by suitable alternative substances or technologies 
where these are economically and technically viable. To this end all 
manufacturers, importers and downstream users applying for authoris­
ations shall analyse the availability of alternatives and consider their 
risks, and the technical and economic feasibility of substitution. 
Article 56 
General provisions 
1. 
A manufacturer, importer or downstream user shall not place a 
substance on the market for a use or use it himself if that substance is 
included in Annex XIV, unless: 
(a) the use(s) of that substance on its own or in a ►M3 mixture ◄ or 
the incorporation of the substance into an article for which the 
substance is placed on the market or for which he uses the 
substance himself has been authorised in accordance with Articles 
60 to 64; or 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 57 
(b) the use(s) of that substance on its own or in a ►M3 mixture ◄ or 
the incorporation of the substance into an article for which the 
substance is placed on the market or for which he uses the 
substance himself has been exempted from the authorisation 
requirement in Annex XIV itself in accordance with Article 58(2); or 
(c) the date referred to in Article 58(1)(c)(i) has not been reached; or 
(d) the date referred to in Article 58(1)(c)(i) has been reached and he 
made an application 18 months before that date but a decision on 
the application for authorisation has not yet been taken; or 
(e) in cases where the substance is placed on the market, authorisation 
for that use has been granted to his immediate downstream user. 
2. 
A downstream user may use a substance meeting the criteria set 
out in paragraph 1 provided that the use is in accordance with the 
conditions of an authorisation granted to an actor up his supply chain 
for that use. 
3. 
Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the use of substances in 
scientific research and development. Annex XIV shall specify if para­
graphs 1 and 2 apply to product and process orientated research and 
development as well as the maximum quantity exempted. 
4. 
Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the following uses of 
substances: 
(a) uses in plant protection products within the scope of Directive 
91/414/EEC; 
(b) uses in biocidal products within the scope of Directive 98/8/EC; 
(c) use as motor fuels covered by Directive 98/70/EC of the European 
Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the 
quality of petrol and diesel fuels ( 1 ); 
(d) uses as fuel in mobile or fixed combustion plants of mineral oil 
products and use as fuels in closed systems. 
5. 
In the case of substances that are subject to authorisation only 
because they meet the criteria in Article 57(a), (b) or (c) or because 
they are identified in accordance with Article 57(f) only because of 
hazards to human health, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not 
apply to the following uses: 
(a) uses in cosmetic products within the scope of Directive 
76/768/EEC; 
(b) uses in food contact materials within the scope of Regulation (EC) 
No 1935/2004. 
6. 
Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the use of substances when 
they are present in ►M3 mixtures ◄: 
(a) for substances referred to in Article 57(d), (e) and (f), below a 
concentration limit of 0,1 % weight by weight (w/w);

1882/2003.

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 58 
(b) for all other substances, below the values specified in Article 11(3) 
of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 which result in the classification 
of the mixture as hazardous. 
▼C1 
Article 57 
Substances to be included in Annex XIV 
The following substances may be included in Annex XIV in accordance 
with the procedure laid down in Article 58: 
▼M3 
(a) substances meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class 
carcinogenicity category 1A or 1B in accordance with section 3.6 of 
Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008; 
(b) substances meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class 
germ cell mutagenicity category 1A or 1B in accordance with 
section 3.5 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008; 
(c) substances meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class 
reproductive toxicity category 1A or 1B, adverse effects on sexual 
function and fertility or on development in accordance with section 
3.7 of Annex I to Regulation(EC) No 1272/2008; 
▼C1 
(d) substances which are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic in 
accordance with the criteria set out in Annex XIII of this Regu­
lation; 
(e) substances which are very persistent and very bioaccumulative in 
accordance with the criteria set out in Annex XIII of this Regu­
lation; 
(f) substances — such as those having endocrine disrupting properties 
or those having persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic properties or 
very persistent and very bioaccumulative properties, which do not 
fulfil the criteria of points (d) or (e) — for which there is scientific 
evidence of probable serious effects to human health or the envi­
ronment which give rise to an equivalent level of concern to those 
of other substances listed in points (a) to (e) and which are 
identified on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the 
procedure set out in Article 59. 
Article 58 
Inclusion of substances in Annex XIV 
1. 
Whenever a decision is taken to include in Annex XIV substances 
referred to in Article 57, such a decision shall be taken in accordance 
with the procedure referred to in Article 133(4). It shall specify for each 
substance: 
(a) the identity of the substance as specified in Section 2 of Annex VI; 
(b) the intrinsic property (properties) of the substance referred to in 
Article 57; 
▼M3

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 59 
(c) transitional arrangements: 
(i) the date(s) from which the placing on the market and the use of 
the substance shall be prohibited unless an authorisation is 
granted (hereinafter referred to as the sunset date) which 
should take into account, where appropriate, the production 
cycle specified for that use; 
(ii) a date or dates at least 18 months before the sunset date(s) by 
which applications must be received if the applicant wishes to 
continue to use the substance or place it on the market for 
certain uses after the sunset date(s); these continued uses shall 
be allowed after the sunset date until a decision on the appli­
cation for authorisation is taken; 
(d) review periods for certain uses, if appropriate; 
(e) uses or categories of uses exempted from the authorisation 
requirement, if any, and conditions for such exemptions, if any. 
2. 
Uses or categories of uses may be exempted from the authoris­
ation requirement provided that, on the basis of the existing specific 
Community legislation imposing minimum requirements relating to the 
protection of human health or the environment for the use of the 
substance, the risk is properly controlled. In the establishment of such 
exemptions, account shall be taken, in particular, of the proportionality 
of risk to human health and the environment related to the nature of the 
substance, such as where the risk is modified by the physical form. 
3. 
Prior to a decision to include substances in Annex XIV, the 
Agency shall, taking into account the opinion of the Member State 
Committee, recommend priority substances to be included specifying 
for each substance the items set out in paragraph 1. Priority shall 
normally be given to substances with: 
(a) PBT or vPvB properties; or 
(b) wide dispersive use; or 
(c) high volumes. 
The number of substances included in Annex XIV and the dates 
specified under paragraph 1 shall also take account of the Agency's 
capacity to handle applications in the time provided for. The Agency 
shall make its first recommendation of priority substances to be included 
in Annex XIV by 1 June 2009. The Agency shall make further recom­
mendations at least every second year with a view to including further 
substances in Annex XIV. 
4. 
Before the Agency sends its recommendation to the Commission it 
shall make it publicly available on its website, clearly indicating the 
date of publication, taking into account Articles 118 and 119 on access 
to information. The Agency shall invite all interested parties to submit 
comments within three months of the date of publication, in particular 
on uses which should be exempt from the authorisation requirement. 
The Agency shall update its recommendation, taking into account the 
comments received. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 60 
5. 
Subject to paragraph 6, after inclusion of a substance in Annex 
XIV, this substance shall not be subjected to new restrictions under the 
procedure outlined in Title VIII covering the risks to human health or 
the environment from the use of the substance on its own, in a 
►M3 mixture ◄ or incorporation of a substance in an article arising 
from the intrinsic properties specified in Annex XIV. 
6. 
A substance listed in Annex XIV may be subjected to new 
restrictions under the procedure outlined in Title VIII covering the 
risks to human health or the environment from the presence of the 
substance in (an) article(s). 
7. 
Substances for which all uses have been prohibited under Title 
VIII or by other Community legislation shall not be included in Annex 
XIV or shall be removed from it. 
8. 
Substances which as a result of new information no longer meet 
the criteria of Article 57 shall be removed from Annex XIV in 
accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 133(4). 
Article 59 
Identification of substances referred to in Article 57 
1. 
The procedure set out in paragraphs 2 to 10 of this Article shall 
apply for the purpose of identifying substances meeting the criteria 
referred to in Article 57 and establishing a candidate list for eventual 
inclusion in Annex XIV. The Agency shall indicate, within this list, the 
substances that are on its work programme according to Article 83(3)(e). 
2. 
The Commission may ask the Agency to prepare a dossier in 
accordance with relevant Sections of Annex XV for substances which 
in its opinion meet the criteria set out in Article 57. ►M3 The dossier 
may be limited, if appropriate, to a reference to an entry in Part 3 of 
Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. ◄ The Agency shall 
make this dossier available to the Member States. 
3. 
Any Member State may prepare a dossier in accordance with 
Annex XV for substances which in its opinion meet the criteria set 
out in Article 57 and forward it to the Agency. ►M3 The dossier 
may be limited, if appropriate, to a reference to an entry in Part 3 of 
Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. ◄ The Agency shall 
make this dossier available within 30 days of receipt to the other

60-day period referred to in paragraph 5. 
8. 
If, within 30 days of the referral, the Member State Committee 
reaches a unanimous agreement on the identification, the Agency shall 
include the substance in the list referred to in paragraph 1. The Agency 
may include that substance in its recommendations under Article 58(3). 
9. 
If the Member State Committee fails to reach a unanimous 
agreement, the Commission shall prepare a draft proposal on the identi­
fication of the substance within three months of receipt of the opinion of 
the Member State Committee. A final decision on the identification of 
the substance shall be taken in accordance with the procedure referred 
to in Article 133(3). 
10. 
The Agency shall publish and update the list referred to in 
paragraph 1 on its website without delay after a decision on inclusion 
of a substance has been taken. 
CHAPTER 2 
Granting of authorisations 
Article 60 
Granting of authorisations 
1. 
The Commission shall be responsible for taking decisions on 
applications for authorisations in accordance with this Title. 
2. 
Without prejudice to paragraph 3, an authorisation shall be granted 
if the risk to human health or the environment from the use of a 
substance arising from the intrinsic properties specified in Annex XIV 
is adequately controlled in accordance with Section 6.4 of Annex I and 
as documented in the applicant's chemical safety report, taking into 
account the opinion of the Committee for Risk Assessment referred to 
in Article 64(4)(a). When granting the authorisation, and in any 
conditions imposed therein, the Commission shall take into account 
all discharges, emissions and losses, including risks arising from 
diffuse or dispersive uses, known at the time of the decision. 
The Commission shall not consider the risks to human health arising 
from the use of a substance in a medical device regulated by Council 
Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the 
laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical 
devices ( 1 ), Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning 
medical devices ( 2 ) or Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament 
and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical 
devices ( 3 ).

02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 62 
3. 
Paragraph 2 shall not apply to: 
(a) substances meeting the criteria in Article 57(a), (b), (c) or (f) for 
which it is not possible to determine a threshold in accordance with 
Section 6.4 of Annex I; 
(b) substances meeting the criteria in Article 57(d) or (e); 
(c) substances identified under Article 57(f) having persistent, bioac­
cumulative and toxic properties or very persistent and very bioac­
cumulative properties. 
4. 
If an authorisation cannot be granted under paragraph 2 or for 
substances listed in paragraph 3, an authorisation may only be 
granted if it is shown that socio-economic benefits outweigh the risk 
to human health or the environment arising from the use of the 
substance and if there are no suitable alternative substances or tech­
nologies. This decision shall be taken after consideration of all of the 
following elements and taking into account the opinions of the 
Committee for Risk Assessment and the Committee for Socio- 
economic Analysis referred to in Article 64(4)(a) and (b): 
(a) the risk posed by the uses of the substance, including the appropri­
ateness and effectiveness of the risk management measures 
proposed; 
(b) the socio-economic benefits arising from its use and the socio- 
economic implications of a refusal to authorise as demonstrated 
by the applicant or other interested parties; 
(c) the analysis of the alternatives submitted by the applicant under 
Article 62(4)(e) or any substitution plan submitted by the 
applicant under Article 62(4)(f), and any third party contributions 
submitted under Article 64(2); 
(d) available information on the risks to human health or the environ­
ment of any alternative substances or technologies. 
5. 
When assessing whether suitable alternative substances or tech­
nologies are available, all relevant aspects shall be taken into account 
by the Commission, including: 
(a) whether the transfer to alternatives would result in reduced overall 
risks to human health and the environment, taking into account the 
appropriateness and effectiveness of risk management measures; 
(b) the technical and economic feasibility of alternatives for the 
applicant. 
6. 
A use shall not be authorised if this would constitute a relaxation 
of a restriction set out in Annex XVII. 
7. 
An authorisation shall be granted only if the application is made in 
conformity with the requirements of Article 62. 
8. 
Authorisations shall be subject to a time-limited review without 
prejudice to any decision on a future review period and shall normally 
be subject to conditions, including monitoring. The duration of the time- 
limited review for any authorisation shall be determined on a case-by- 
case basis taking into account all relevant information including the 
elements listed in paragraph 4(a) to (d), as appropriate. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 63 
9. 
The authorisation shall specify: 
(a) the person(s) to whom the authorisation is granted; 
(b) the identity of the substance(s); 
(c) the use(s) for which the authorisation is granted; 
(d) any conditions under which the authorisation is granted; 
(e) the time-limited review period; 
(f) any monitoring arrangement. 
10. 
Notwithstanding any conditions of an authorisation, the holder 
shall ensure that the exposure is reduced to as low a level as is tech­
nically and practically possible. 
Article 61 
Review of authorisations 
1. 
Authorisations granted in accordance with Article 60 shall be 
regarded as valid until the Commission decides to amend or withdraw 
the authorisation in the context of a review, provided that the holder of 
the authorisation submits a review report at least 18 months before the 
expiry of the time-limited review period. Rather than re-submitting all 
elements of the original application for the current authorisation, the 
holder of an authorisation may submit only the number of the current 
authorisation, subject to the second, third and fourth subparagraphs. 
A holder of an authorisation granted in accordance with Article 60 shall 
submit an update of the analysis of alternatives referred to in 
Article 62(4)(e), including information about any relevant research 
and development activities by the applicant, if appropriate, and any 
substitution plan submitted under Article 62(4)(f). If the update of the 
analysis of alternatives shows that there is a suitable alternative 
available taking into account the elements in Article 60(5), he shall 
submit a substitution plan, including a timetable for proposed actions 
by the applicant. If the holder cannot demonstrate that the risk is 
adequately controlled, he shall also submit an update of the socio- 
economic analysis contained in the original application. 
If he can now demonstrate that the risk is adequately controlled, he shall 
submit an update of the chemical safety report. 
If any other elements of the original application have changed, he shall 
also submit updates of these element(s). 
When any updated information is submitted in accordance with this 
paragraph, any decision to amend or withdraw the authorisation in the 
context of the review shall be taken in accordance with the procedure 
referred to in Article 64 applied mutatis mutandis. 
2. 
Authorisations may be reviewed at any time if: 
(a) the circumstances of the original authorisation have changed so as 
to affect the risk to human health or the environment, or the socio- 
economic impact; or 
(b) new information on possible substitutes becomes available. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 64 
The Commission shall set a reasonable deadline by which the holder(s) 
of the authorisation may submit further information necessary for the 
review and indicate by when it will take a decision in accordance with 
Article 64. 
3. 
In its review decision the Commission may, if circumstances have 
changed and taking into account the principle of proportionality, amend 
or withdraw the authorisation, if under the changed circumstances it 
would not have been granted or if suitable alternatives in accordance 
with Article 60(5) become available. In the latter case the Commission 
shall require the holder of the authorisation to present a substitution plan 
if he has not already done so as part of his application or update. 
In cases where there is a serious and immediate risk for human health or 
the environment, the Commission may suspend the authorisation 
pending the review, taking into account the principle of proportionality. 
4. 
If an environmental quality standard referred to in Directive 
96/61/EC is not met, the authorisations granted for the use of the 
substance concerned may be reviewed. 
5. 
If the environmental objectives as referred to in Article 4(1) of 
Directive 2000/60/EC are not met, the authorisations granted for the use 
of the substance concerned in the relevant river basin may be reviewed. 
6. 
If a use of a substance is subsequently prohibited or otherwise 
restricted in Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants ( 1 ), 
the Commission shall withdraw the authorisation for that use. 
Article 62 
Applications for authorisations 
1. 
An application for an authorisation shall be made to the Agency. 
2. 
Applications for authorisation may be made by the manufac­
turer(s), importer(s) and/or downstream user(s) of the substance. Appli­
cations may be made by one or several persons. 
3. 
Applications may be made for one or several substances, that meet 
the definition of a group of substances in Section 1.5 of Annex XI, and 
for one or several uses. Applications may be made for the applicant's 
own use(s) and/or for uses for which he intends to place the substance 
on the market.

▼C1 
Article 69 
Preparation of a proposal 
1. 
If the Commission considers that the manufacture, placing on the 
market or use of a substance on its own, in a ►M3 mixture ◄ or in an 
article poses a risk to human health or the environment that is not 
adequately controlled and needs to be addressed, it shall ask the 
Agency to prepare a dossier which conforms to the requirements of 
Annex XV. 
2. 
After the date referred to in Article 58(1)(c)(i) for a substance 
listed in Annex XIV, the Agency shall consider whether the use of 
that substance in articles poses a risk to human health or the environ­
ment that is not adequately controlled. If the Agency considers that the 
risk is not adequately controlled, it shall prepare a dossier which 
conforms to the requirements of Annex XV. 
3. 
Within 12 months of the receipt of the request from the 
Commission in paragraph 1 and if this dossier demonstrates that 
action on a Community-wide basis is necessary, beyond any measures 
already in place, the Agency shall suggest restrictions, in order to 
initiate the restrictions process. 
4. 
If a Member State considers that the manufacture, placing on the 
market or use of a substance on its own, in a ►M3 mixture ◄ or in an 
article poses a risk to human health or the environment that is not 
adequately controlled and needs to be addressed it shall notify the 
Agency that it proposes to prepare a dossier which conforms to the 
requirements of the relevant sections of Annex XV. If the substance 
is not on the list maintained by the Agency referred to in paragraph 5 of 
this Article, the Member State shall prepare a dossier which conforms to 
the requirements of Annex XV within 12 months of the notification to 
the Agency. If this dossier demonstrates that action on a Community- 
wide basis is necessary, beyond any measures already in place, the 
Member State shall submit it to the Agency in the format outlined in 
Annex XV, in order to initiate the restrictions process. 
The Agency or Member States shall refer to any dossier, chemical 
safety report or risk assessment submitted to the Agency or Member 
State under this Regulation. The Agency or Member States shall also 
refer to any relevant risk assessment submitted for the purposes of other 
Community Regulations or Directives. To this end other bodies, such as 
agencies, established under Community law and carrying out a similar 
task shall provide information to the Agency or Member State 
concerned on request.

established, and after publishing a report on the following: 
(a) the risks posed by polymers in comparison with other substances; 
(b) the need, if any, to register certain types of polymer, taking account 
of competitiveness and innovation on the one hand and the 
protection of human health and the environment on the other. 
3. 
The report, referred to in Article 117(4), on the experience 
acquired with the operation of this Regulation shall include a review 
of the requirements relating to registration of substances manufactured 
or imported only in quantities starting at one tonne but less than 10 
tonnes per year per manufacturer or importer. On the basis of that 
review, the Commission may present legislative proposals to modify 
the information requirements for substances manufactured or imported 
in quantities of one tonne or more up to 10 tonnes per year per manu­
facturer or importer, taking into account the latest developments, for 
example in relation to alternative testing and (quantitative) structure- 
activity relationships ((Q)SARs). 
4. 
The Commission shall carry out a review of Annexes I, IV and V 
by 1 June 2008, with a view to proposing amendments, if appropriate, 
to them in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 131. 
5. 
The Commission shall carry out a review of Annex XIII by 
1 December 2008, to assess the adequacy of the criteria for identifying 
substances which are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic or very 
persistent and very bioaccumulative, with a view to proposing an 
amendment to it, if appropriate, in accordance with the procedure 
referred to in Article 133(4).

basis of that review the Commission may, if appropriate, present legis­
lative proposals. 
8. 
By 1 June 2019, the Commission shall carry out a review to assess 
whether or not to extend the scope of Article 33 to cover other 
dangerous substances, taking into account the practical experience in 
implementing that Article. On the basis of that review, the Commission 
may, if appropriate, present legislative proposals to extend that 
obligation. 
9. 
In accordance with the objective of promoting non-animal testing 
and the replacement, reduction or refinement of animal testing required 
under this Regulation, the Commission shall review the testing 
requirements of Section 8.7 of Annex VIII by 1 June 2019. On the 
basis of this review, while ensuring a high level of protection of health 
and the environment, the Commission may propose an amendment in 
accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 133(4).

ANNEX I 
GENERAL 
PROVISIONS 
FOR 
ASSESSING 
SUBSTANCES 
AND 
PREPARING CHEMICAL SAFETY REPORTS 
0. 
INTRODUCTION 
▼M51 
0.1. 
The purpose of this Annex is to set out how manufacturers and 
importers are to assess and document that the risks arising from the 
substance they manufacture or import are adequately controlled during 
manufacture and their own use(s) and that others further down the 
supply chain can adequately control the risks. The chemical safety 
report shall also describe whether and which different nanoforms of 
substances as characterised in Annex VI are manufactured and 
imported, including an adequate justification for each information 
requirement describing when and how information on one form is 
used to demonstrate safety of other forms. The requirements speof the 
following hazard classes or categories setcific to nanoforms of a 
substance in this Annex apply to all nanoforms covered by the regis­
tration and without prejudice to requirements applicable to other forms 
of that substance. This Annex shall also apply adapted as necessary to 
producers and importers of articles required to make a chemical safety 
assessment as part of a registration. 
▼C1 
0.2. 
The chemical safety assessment shall be prepared by one or more 
competent person(s) who have appropriate experience and received 
appropriate training, including refresher training. 
▼M51 
0.3. 
The chemical safety assessment of a manufacturer shall address the 
manufacture of a substance and all the identified uses. The chemical 
safety assessment of an importer shall address all identified uses. The 
chemical safety assessment shall consider the use of the substance on its 
own (including any major impurities and additives), in a mixture and in 
an article, as defined by the identified uses. The assessment shall 
consider all stages of the life-cycle of the substance resulting from the 
manufacture and identified uses. The assessment shall address all 
nanoforms that are covered by the registration. The justifications and 
conclusions drawn from the assessment shall be relevant to these nano­
forms. The chemical safety assessment shall be based on a comparison 
of the potential adverse effects of a substance with the known or 
reasonably foreseeable exposure of man and/or the environment to 
that substance taking into account implemented and recommended risk 
management measures and operational conditions. 
0.4. 
Substances whose physicochemical, toxicological and eco-toxicological 
properties are likely to be similar or follow a regular pattern as a result 
of structural similarity may be considered as a group, or ‘category’ of 
substances. If the manufacturer or importer considers that the chemical 
safety assessment carried out for one substance is sufficient to assess 
and document that the risks arising from another substance or from a 
group or ‘category’ of substances are adequately controlled then he can 
use that chemical safety assessment for the other substance or group or 
‘category’ of substances. The manufacturer or importer shall provide a 
justification for this. Where any of the substances exists in one or more 
nanoforms and data from one form are used in demonstration of the safe 
use of other forms, in accordance with the general rules set out in 
Annex XI, a scientific justification shall be given on how, applying 
the rules for grouping and read-across, the data from a specific test or 
other information (e.g. methods, results or conclusions) can be used for 
the other forms of the substance. Similar considerations apply to 
exposure scenarios and risk management measures. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 103 
0.5. 
The chemical safety assessment shall be based on the information on the 
substance contained in the technical dossier and on other available and 
relevant information. Manufacturers or importers submitting a proposal 
for testing in accordance with Annexes IX and X shall record this under 
the relevant heading of the chemical safety report. Available information 
from assessments carried out under other international and national 
programmes shall be included. Where available and appropriate, an 
assessment carried out under Community legislation (e.g. risk 
assessments completed under Regulation (EEC) No 793/93) shall be 
taken into account in the development of, and reflected in, the 
chemical safety report. Deviations from such assessments shall be 
justified. 
Thus the information to be considered includes information related to 
the hazards of the substance, the exposure arising from the manufacture 
or import, the identified uses of the substance, operational conditions 
and risk management measures applied or recommended to downstream 
users to be taken into account. 
In accordance with section 3 of Annex XI in some cases, it may not be 
necessary to generate missing information, because risk management 
measures and operational conditions which are necessary to control a 
well-characterised risk may also be sufficient to control other potential 
risks, which will not therefore need to be characterised precisely. 
▼M51 
If the manufacturer or importer considers that further information is 
necessary for producing his chemical safety report and that this 
information can only be obtained by performing tests in accordance 
with Annex IX or X, he shall submit a proposal for a testing 
strategy, explaining why he considers that additional information is 
necessary and record this in the chemical safety report under the appro­
priate heading. Where considered necessary, the proposal for a testing 
strategy may concern several studies addressing respectively different 
forms of the same substance for the same information requirement. 
While waiting for results of further testing, he shall record in his 
chemical safety report, and include in the exposure scenario developed, 
the interim risk management measures that he has put in place and those 
he recommends to downstream users intended to manage the risks being 
explored. The exposure scenarios and interim risk management 
measures recommended shall address all nanoforms that are covered 
by the registration. 
▼M10 
0.6. 
Steps of a chemical safety assessment 
0.6.1. 
A chemical safety assessment performed by a manufacturer or an 
importer for a substance shall include the following steps 1 to 4 in 
accordance with the respective sections of this Annex: 
1. Human health hazard assessment. 
2. Human health hazard assessment of physicochemical properties. 
3. Environmental hazard assessment. 
4. PBT and vPvB assessment. 
0.6.2. 
In the cases referred to in point 0.6.3 the chemical safety assessment 
shall also include the following steps 5 and 6 in accordance with 
Sections 5 and 6 of this Annex: 
5. 
Exposure assessment. 
5.1. The generation of exposure scenario(s) (or the identification of 
relevant use and exposure categories, if appropriate). 
5.2. Exposure estimation. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 104 
6. 
Risk characterisation. 
▼M51 
0.6.3. 
Where as a result of steps 1 to 4 the manufacturer or importer concludes 
that the substance or, when applicable, nanoforms thereof fulfils the 
criteria for any of the following hazard classes or categories set out 
in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 or is assessed to be a 
PBT or vPvB, the chemical safety assessment shall also include steps 5 
and 6 in accordance with Sections 5 and 6 of this Annex: 
(a) hazard classes 2.1 to 2.4, 2.6 and 2.7, 2.8 types A and B, 2.9, 2.10, 
2.12, 2.13 categories 1 and 2, 2.14 categories 1 and 2, and 2.15 
types A to F; 
(b) hazard classes 3.1 to 3.6, 3.7 adverse effects on sexual function and 
fertility or on development, 3.8 effects other than narcotic effects, 
3.9, and 3.10; 
(c) hazard class 4.1; 
(d) hazard class 5.1. 
▼M10 
0.6.4. 
A summary of all the relevant information used in addressing the points 
above shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical 
Safety Report (Section 7). 
▼C1 
0.7. 
The main element of the exposure part of the chemical safety report is 
the description of the exposure scenario(s) implemented for the manu­
facturer's production, the manufacturer or importer's own use, and those 
recommended by the manufacturer or importer to be implemented for 
the identified use(s). 
An exposure scenario is the set of conditions that describe how the 
substance is manufactured or used during its life-cycle and how the 
manufacturer or importer controls, or recommends downstream users 
to control, exposures of humans and the environment. These sets of 
conditions contain a description of both the risk management 
measures and operational conditions which the manufacturer or 
importer has implemented or recommends to be implemented by down­
stream users. 
If the substance is placed on the market, the relevant exposure scen­
ario(s), including the risk management measures and operational 
conditions shall be included in an annex to the safety data sheet in 
accordance with Annex II. 
0.8. 
The level of detail required in describing an exposure scenario will vary 
substantially from case to case, depending on the use of a substance, its 
hazardous properties and the amount of information available to the 
manufacturer or importer. Exposure scenarios may describe the appro­
priate risk management measures for several individual processes or 
uses of a substance. An exposure scenario may thereby cover a large 
range of processes or uses. Exposure scenarios covering a wide range of 
processes or uses may be referred to as Exposure Categories. Further 
mention of Exposure Scenario in this Annex and Annex II includes 
Exposure Categories if they are developed. 
0.9. 
Where information is not necessary in accordance with Annex XI, this 
fact shall be stated under the appropriate heading of the chemical safety 
report and a reference shall be made to the justification in the technical 
dossier. The fact that no information is required shall also be stated in 
the safety data sheet. 
0.10. 
In relation to particular effects, such as ozone depletion, photochemical 
ozone creation potential, strong odour and tainting, for which the 
procedures set out in Sections 1 to 6 are impracticable, the risks asso­
ciated with such effects shall be assessed on a case-by-case basis and 
the manufacturer or importer shall include a full description and justifi­
cation of such assessments in the chemical safety report and summarised 
in the safety data sheet. 
▼M10

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 105 
0.11. 
When assessing the risk of the use of one or more substances incor­
porated into a special ►M3 mixture ◄ (for instance alloys), the way 
the constituent substances are bonded in the chemical matrix shall be 
taken into account. 
▼M51 
0.11.bis When nanoforms are covered by the chemical safety assessment, an 
appropriate metric for the assessment and presentation of the results 
in steps 1-6 of the chemical safety assessment under 0.6.1 and 0.6.2 
shall be considered, with the justification included in the chemical safety 
report and summarised in the safety data sheet. A multiple metric pres­
entation, including mass metric information, is preferable. When 
possible, a method for reciprocal conversion shall be indicated. 
▼C1 
0.12. 
Where the methodology described in this Annex is not appropriate, 
details of alternative methodology used shall be explained and 
justified in the chemical safety report. 
0.13. 
Part A of the chemical safety report shall include a declaration that the 
risk management measures outlined in the relevant exposure scenarios 
for the manufacturer's or importer's own use(s) are implemented by the 
manufacturer or importer and that those exposure scenarios for the 
identified uses are communicated to distributors and downstream users 
in the safety data sheet(s). 
1. 
HUMAN HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT 
1.0. 
Introduction 
▼M10 
1.0.1. 
The objectives of the human health hazard assessment shall be to 
determine the classification of a substance in accordance with Regu­
lation (EC) No 1272/2008; and to derive levels of exposure to the 
substance above which humans should not be exposed. This level of 
exposure is known as the Derived No-Effect Level (DNEL). 
1.0.2. 
The human health hazard assessment shall consider the toxicokinetic 
profile (i.e. absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination) of 
the substance and the following groups of effects: 
(1) acute effects such as acute toxicity, irritation and corrosivity; 
(2) sensitisation; 
(3) repeated dose toxicity; and 
(4) CMR effects (carcinogenity, germ cell mutagenicity and toxicity for 
reproduction). 
Based on all the available information, other effects shall be considered 
when necessary. 
▼C1 
1.0.3. 
The hazard assessment shall comprise the following four steps: 
Step 1: Evaluation of non-human information. 
Step 2: Evaluation of human information. 
Step 3: Classification and Labelling. 
Step 4: Derivation of DNELs. 
▼M51 
The assessment shall address all nanoforms that are covered by the 
registration. 
▼C1 
1.0.4. 
The first three steps shall be undertaken for every effect for which 
information is available and shall be recorded under the relevant 
section of the Chemical Safety Report and where required and in 
accordance with Article 31, summarised in the Safety Data Sheet 
under headings 2 and 11. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 106 
1.0.5. 
For any effect for which no relevant information is available, the 
relevant section shall contain the sentence: ‘This information is not 
available’. The justification, including reference to any literature 
search carried out, shall be included in the technical dossier. 
1.0.6. 
Step 4 of the human health hazard assessment shall be undertaken by 
integrating the results from the first three steps and shall be included 
under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report and 
summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under heading 8.1. 
1.1. 
Step 1: Evaluation of non-human information 
1.1.1. 
The evaluation of non-human information shall comprise: 
— the hazard identification for the effect based on all available non- 
human information, 
— the establishment of the quantitative dose (concentration)-response 
(effect) relationship. 
1.1.2. 
When it is not possible to establish the quantitative dose (concen­
tration)-response (effect) relationship, then this should be justified and 
a semi-quantitative or qualitative analysis shall be included. For 
instance, for acute effects it is usually not possible to establish the 
quantitative dose (concentration)-response (effect) relationship on the 
basis of the results of a test conducted in accordance with test 
methods laid down in a Commission Regulation as specified in 
Article 13(3). In such cases it suffices to determine whether and to 
which degree the substance has an inherent capacity to cause the effect. 
▼M10 
1.1.3. 
All non-human information used to assess a particular effect on humans 
and to establish the dose (concentration) – response (effect) relationship, 
shall be briefly presented, if possible in the form of a table or tables, 
distinguishing between in vitro, in vivo and other information. The 
relevant test results (e.g. ATE, LD50, NO(A)EL or LO(A)EL) and 
test conditions (e.g. test duration, route of administration) and other 
relevant information shall be presented, in internationally recognised 
units of measurement for that effect. 
▼C1 
1.1.4. 
If one study is available then a robust study summary should be 
prepared for that study. If there are several studies addressing the 
same effect, then, having taken into account possible variables (e.g. 
conduct, adequacy, relevance of test species, quality of results, etc.), 
normally the study or studies giving rise to the highest concern shall 
be used to establish the DNELs and a robust study summary shall be 
prepared for that study or studies and included as part of the technical 
dossier. Robust summaries will be required of all key data used in the 
hazard assessment. If the study or studies giving rise to the highest 
concern are not used, then this shall be fully justified and included as 
part of the technical dossier, not only for the study being used but also 
for all studies demonstrating a higher concern than the study being used. 
It is important irrespective of whether hazards have been identified or 
not that the validity of the study be considered. 
1.2. 
Step 2: Evaluation of human information 
If no human information is available, this part shall contain the 
statement: ‘No human information is available’. However, if human 
information is available, it shall be presented, if possible in the form 
of a table. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 107 
1.3. 
Step 3: Classification and Labelling 
▼M10 
1.3.1. 
The appropriate classification developed in accordance with the criteria 
in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 shall be presented and justified. 
Where applicable, Specific Concentration limits resulting from the appli­
cation of Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and Articles 4 to 
7 of Directive 1999/45/EC shall be presented and, if they are not 
included in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, 
justified. 
▼M51 
The assessment should always include a statement as to whether the 
substance or, when applicable, nanoforms thereof fulfils or does not 
fulfil the criteria given in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 for classifi­
cation in the hazard class carcinogenicity category 1A or 1B, in the 
hazard class germ cell mutagenicity category 1A or 1B or in the hazard 
class reproductive toxicity category 1A or 1B. 
1.3.2. 
If the information is inadequate to decide whether a substance or, when 
applicable, nanoforms thereof should be classified for a particular hazard 
class or category, the registrants shall indicate and justify the action or 
decision he has taken as a result. 
▼C1 
1.4. 
Step 4: Identification of DNEL(s) 
1.4.1. 
Based on the outcomes of steps 1 and 2, (a) DNEL(s) shall be estab­
lished for the substance, reflecting the likely route(s), duration and 
frequency of exposure. ►M10 For some hazard classes, especially 
germ cell mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, the available information 
may not enable a toxicological threshold, and therefore a DNEL, to 
be established. ◄ If justified by the exposure scenario(s), a single 
DNEL may be sufficient. However, taking into account the available 
information and the exposure scenario(s) in Section 9 of the Chemical 
Safety Report it may be necessary to identify different DNELs for each 
relevant human population (e.g. workers, consumers and humans liable 
to exposure indirectly via the environment) and possibly for certain 
vulnerable sub-populations (e.g. children, pregnant women) and for 
different routes of exposure. A full justification shall be given spec­
ifying, inter alia, the choice of the information used, the route of 
exposure (oral, dermal, inhalation) and the duration and frequency of 
exposure to the substance for which the DNEL is valid. If more than 
one route of exposure is likely to occur, then a DNEL shall be estab­
lished for each route of exposure and for the exposure from all routes 
combined. When establishing the DNEL, the following factors shall, 
inter alia, be taken into account: 
(a) the uncertainty arising, among other factors, from the variability in 
the experimental information and from intra- and inter-species vari­
ation; 
(b) the nature and severity of the effect; 
(c) the sensitivity of the human (sub-)population to which the quanti­
tative and/or qualitative information on exposure applies. 
1.4.2. 
If it is not possible to identify a DNEL, then this shall be clearly stated 
and fully justified. 
2. 
PHYSICOCHEMICAL HAZARD ASSESSMENT 
▼M10 
2.1. 
The objective of the hazard assessment for physicochemical properties 
shall be to determine the classification of a substance in accordance with 
Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 108 
2.2. 
As a minimum, the potential effects to human health shall be assessed 
for the following physicochemical properties: 
— explosivity, 
— flammability, 
— oxidising potential. 
▼M51 
If the information is inadequate to decide whether a substance or, when 
applicable, nanoforms thereof should be classified for a particular hazard 
class or category, the registrant shall indicate and justify the action or 
decision he has taken as a result. 
▼C1 
2.3. 
The assessment of each effect shall be presented under the relevant 
heading of the Chemical Safety Report (Section 7) and where 
required and in accordance with Article 31, summarised in the Safety 
Data Sheet under headings 2 and 9. 
2.4. 
For every physicochemical property, the assessment shall entail an 
evaluation of the inherent capacity of the substance to cause the 
effect resulting from the manufacture and identified uses. 
▼M10 
2.5. 
The appropriate classification developed in accordance with the criteria 
in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 shall be presented and justified. 
▼C1 
3. 
ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD ASSESSMENT 
3.0. 
Introduction 
▼M10 
3.0.1. 
The objective of the environmental hazard assessment shall be to 
determine the classification of a substance in accordance with Regu­
lation (EC) No 1272/2008 and to identify the concentration of the 
substance below which adverse effects in the environmental sphere of 
concern are not expected to occur. This concentration is known as the 
Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC). 
▼C1 
3.0.2. 
The environmental hazard assessment shall consider the potential effects 
on the environment, comprising the (1) aquatic (including sediment), (2) 
terrestrial and (3) atmospheric compartments, including the potential 
effects that may occur (4) via food-chain accumulation. In addition, 
the potential effects on the (5) microbiological activity of sewage 
treatment systems shall be considered. The assessment of the effects 
on each of these five environmental spheres shall be presented under

cation, including reference to any literature research carried out, shall 
be included in the technical dossier. For any environmental sphere for 
which information is available, but the manufacturer or importer 
believes that it is not necessary to conduct the hazard assessment, the 
manufacturer or importer shall present a justification, with reference to 
pertinent information, under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety 
Report (Section 7) and where required and in accordance with 
Article 31, summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under heading 12.

3.0.4. 
The hazard assessment shall comprise the following three steps, which 
shall be clearly identified as such in the Chemical Safety Report: 
Step 1: Evaluation of information. 
Step 2: Classification and Labelling. 
Step 3: Derivation of the PNEC. 
3.1. 
Step 1: Evaluation of information 
3.1.1. 
The evaluation of all available information shall comprise: 
— the hazard identification based on all available information, 
— the establishment of the quantitative dose (concentration)-response 
(effect) relationship. 
3.1.2. 
When it is not possible to establish the quantitative dose (concen­
tration)-response (effect) relationship, then this should be justified and 
a semi-quantitative or qualitative analysis shall be included. 
3.1.3. 
All information used to assess the effects on a specific environmental 
sphere shall be briefly presented, if possible in the form of a table or 
tables. The relevant test results (e.g. LC50 or NOEC) and test conditions 
(e.g. test duration, route of administration) and other relevant 
information shall be presented, in internationally recognised units of 
measurement for that effect. 
3.1.4. 
All information used to assess the environmental fate of the substance 
shall be briefly presented, if possible in the form of a table or tables. 
The relevant test results and test conditions and other relevant 
information shall be presented, in internationally recognised units of 
measurement for that effect. 
3.1.5. 
If one study is available then a robust study summary should be 
prepared for that study. Where there is more than one study addressing 
the same effect, then the study or studies giving rise to the highest 
concern shall be used to draw a conclusion and a robust study 
summary shall be prepared for that study or studies and included as 
part of the technical dossier. Robust summaries will be required of all 
key data used in the hazard assessment. If the study or studies giving 
rise to the highest concern are not used, then this shall be fully justified 
and included as part of the technical dossier, not only for the study 
being used but also for all studies reaching a higher concern than the 
study being used. For substances where all available studies indicate no 
hazards an overall assessment of the validity of all studies should be 
performed. 
3.2. 
Step 2: Classification and Labelling 
▼M51 
3.2.1. 
The appropriate classification developed in accordance with the criteria 
in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 shall be presented and justified. Any 
M-factor resulting from the application of Article 10 of Regulation (EC) 
No 1272/2008 shall be presented and, if it is not included in Part 3 of 
Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, justified. 
The presentation and justification is applied to all nanoforms covered by 
the registration. 
3.2.2. 
If the information is inadequate to decide whether a substance or, when 
applicable, nanoforms thereof should be classified for a particular hazard 
class or category, the registrant shall indicate and justify the action or 
decision he has taken as a result.

02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 110 
3.3. 
Step 3: Identification of the PNEC 
3.3.1. 
Based on the available information, the PNEC for each environmental 
sphere shall be established. The PNEC may be calculated by applying 
an appropriate assessment factor to the effect values (e.g. LC50 or 
NOEC). An assessment factor expresses the difference between effects 
values derived for a limited number of species from laboratory tests and 
the PNEC for the environmental sphere ( 1 ). 
3.3.2. 
If it is not possible to derive the PNEC, then this shall be clearly stated 
and fully justified.

PBT AND VPVB ASSESSMENT 
4.0. 
Introduction 
4.0.1. 
The objective of the PBT and vPvB assessment shall be to determine if 
the substance fulfils the criteria given in Annex XIII and if so, to 
characterise the potential emissions of the substance. A hazard 
assessment in accordance with Sections 1 and 3 of this Annex 
addressing all the long-term effects and the estimation of the long- 
term exposure of humans and the environment as carried out in 
accordance with Section 5 (Exposure Assessment), step 2 (Exposure 
Estimation), cannot be carried out with sufficient reliability for 
substances satisfying the PBT and vPvB criteria in Annex XIII. 
Therefore, a separate PBT and vPvB assessment is required. 
▼M51 
4.0.2. 
The PBT and vPvB assessment shall comprise the following two steps, 
which shall be clearly identified as such in Part B, Section 8 of the 
Chemical Safety report. The assessment shall address all nanoforms that 
are covered by the registration: 
Step 1 : 
Comparison with the Criteria. 
Step 2 : 
Emission Characterisation. 
The assessment shall also be summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under 
heading 12. 
▼M10 
4.1. 
Step 1: Comparison with the criteria 
This part of the PBT and vPvB assessment shall entail the comparison 
of the available information with the criteria given in Section 1 of 
Annex XIII and a statement of whether the substance fulfils or does 
not fulfil the criteria. The assessment shall be conducted in accordance 
with the provisions laid down in the introductory part of Annex XIII as 
well as Sections 2 and 3 of that Annex. 
▼M51 
4.2. 
Step 2: Emission Characterisation 
If the substance fulfils the criteria or it is considered as if it is a PBT or 
vPvB in the registration dossier an emission characterisation shall be 
conducted comprising the relevant parts of the exposure assessment as 
described in Section 5. In particular it shall contain an estimation of the 
amounts of the substance released to the different environmental 
compartments during all activities carried out by the manufacturer or 
importer and all identified uses, and an identification of the likely routes 
by which humans and the environment are exposed to the substance. 
The estimation shall address all nanoforms that are covered by the 
registration. 
▼C1 
( 1 ) In general, the more extensive the data and the longer the duration of the tests, the 
smaller is the degree of uncertainty and the size of the assessment factor. An assessment 
factor of 1 000 is typically applied to the lowest of three short term L(E)C50 values 
derived from species representing different trophic levels and a factor of 10 to the lowest 
of three long-term NOEC values derived from species representing different trophic 
levels.

EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT 
5.0. 
Introduction 
▼M51 
The objective of the exposure assessment shall be to make a quantitative 
and qualitative estimate of the dose/concentration of the substance to 
which humans and the environment are or may be exposed. The 
assessment shall consider all stages of the life-cycle of the substance 
resulting from the manufacture and identified uses and shall cover any 
exposures that may relate to the hazards identified in Sections 1 to 4. 
The assessment shall address all nanoforms that are covered by the 
registration. The exposure assessment shall entail the following two 
steps, which shall be clearly identified as such in the Chemical Safety 
Report: 
▼C1 
Step 1: Generation of exposure scenario(s) or the generation of relevant 
use and exposure categories. 
Step 2: Exposure Estimation. 
Where required and in accordance with Article 31, the exposure scenario 
shall also be included in an annex to the Safety Data Sheet. 
5.1. 
Step 1: Development of exposure scenarios 
5.1.1. Exposure scenarios as described in Sections 0.7 and 0.8 shall be 
generated. Exposure scenarios are the core of the process to carry out 
a chemical safety assessment. The chemical safety assessment process 
may be iterative. The first assessment will be based on the required 
minimum and all available hazard information and on the exposure esti­
mation that corresponds to the initial assumptions about the operating 
conditions and risk management measures (an initial exposure scenario). 
If the initial assumptions lead to a risk characterisation indicating that 
risks to human health and the environment are not adequately controlled, 
then it is necessary to carry out an iterative process with amendment of 
one or a number of factors in hazard or exposure assessment with the aim 
to demonstrate adequate control. The refinement of hazard assessment 
may require generation of additional hazard information. The refinement 
of exposure assessment may involve appropriate alteration of the opera­
tional conditions or risk management measures in the exposure scenario 
or more precise exposure estimation. The exposure scenario, resulting 
from the final iteration (a final exposure scenario), shall be included in 
the chemical safety report and attached to the safety data sheet in 
accordance with Article 31. 
The final exposure scenario shall be presented under the relevant heading 
of the chemical safety report, and included in an annex to the safety data 
sheet, using an appropriate short title giving a brief general description of 
the use, consistent with those given in Section 3.5 of Annex VI. 
Exposure scenarios shall cover any manufacture in the Community and 
all identified uses. 
In particular, an exposure scenario includes, where relevant, a description 
of: 
Operational conditions 
— the processes involved, including the physical form in which the 
substance is manufactured, processed and/or used, 
— the activities of workers related to the processes and the duration and 
frequency of their exposure to the substance, 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 112 
— the activities of consumers and the duration and frequency of their 
exposure to the substance, 
— the duration and frequency of emissions of the substance to the 
different environmental compartments and sewage treatment systems 
and the dilution in the receiving environmental compartment. 
Risk management measures 
— the risk management measures to reduce or avoid direct and indirect 
exposure of humans (including workers and consumers) and the 
different environmental compartments to the substance, 
— the waste management measures to reduce or avoid exposure of 
humans and the environment to the substance during waste disposal 
and/or recycling. 
5.1.2. Where a manufacturer, importer or downstream user applies for an appli­
cation for an authorisation for a specific use, exposure scenarios need 
only be developed for that use and the subsequent life-cycle steps. 
5.2. 
Step 2: Exposure Estimation 
5.2.1. The exposure shall be estimated for each exposure scenario developed 
and shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety 
Report and where required and in accordance with Article 31, 
summarised in an annex to the safety data sheet. The exposure estimation 
entails three elements: (1) emission estimation; (2) assessment of 
chemical fate and pathways; and (3) estimation of exposure levels. 
5.2.2. The emission estimation shall consider the emissions during all relevant 
parts of the life-cycle of the substance resulting from the manufacture and 
each of the identified uses. The life-cycle stages resulting from the manu­
facture of the substance cover, where relevant, the waste stage. The life- 
cycle stages resulting from identified uses cover, where relevant, the 
service-life of articles and the waste stage. The emission estimation 
shall be performed under the assumption that the risk management 
measures and operational conditions described in the exposure scenario 
have been implemented. ►M51 When nanoforms are covered by the 
registration, the emission estimation for these shall, where relevant, 
take account of situations when the conditions outlined in Annex XI 
section 3.2 point (c) are fulfilled. ◄ 
▼M51 
5.2.3. A characterisation of possible degradation, transformation, or reaction 
processes, and an estimation of environmental distribution and fate 
shall be performed. 
When nanoforms are covered by the registration, a characterisation of the 
dissolution rate, the particle aggregation, the agglomeration and of the 
particle surface chemistry changes shall be included. 
▼C1 
5.2.4. An estimation of the exposure levels shall be performed for all human 
populations (workers, consumers and humans liable to exposure indi­
rectly via the environment) and environmental spheres for which 
exposure to the substance is known or reasonably foreseeable. Each 
relevant route of human exposure (inhalation, oral, dermal and 
combined through all relevant routes and sources of exposure) shall be 
addressed. Such estimations shall take account of spatial and temporal 
variations in the exposure pattern. In particular, the exposure estimation 
shall take account of: 
— adequately measured, representative exposure data, 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 113 
— any major impurities and additives in the substance, 
— the quantity in which the substance is produced and/or imported, 
— the quantity for each identified use, 
— implemented or recommended risk management, including the degree 
of containment, 
— duration and frequency of exposure according to the operational 
conditions, 
— the activities of workers related to the processes and the duration and 
frequency of their exposure to the substance, 
— the activities of consumers and the duration and frequency of their 
exposure to the substance, 
— the duration and frequency of emissions of the substance to the 
different environmental compartments and the dilution in the 
receiving environmental compartment, 
— the physicochemical properties of the substance, 
— transformation and/or degradation products, 
— the likely routes of exposure of and potential for absorption in 
humans, 
— the likely pathways to the environment and environmental distribution 
and degradation and/or transformation (see also Section 3 Step 1), 
— scale (geographical) of exposure, 
— matrix dependent release/migration of the substance. 
5.2.5. Where adequately measured representative exposure data are available, 
special consideration shall be given to them when conducting the 
exposure assessment. Appropriate models can be used for the estimation 
of exposure levels. Relevant monitoring data from substances with 
analogous use and exposure patterns or analogous properties can also 
be considered. 
6. 
RISK CHARACTERISATION 
6.1. 
The risk characterisation shall be carried out for each exposure scenario 
and shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety 
Report. 
6.2. 
The risk characterisation shall consider the human populations (exposed 
as workers, consumers or indirectly via the environment and if relevant a 
combination thereof) and the environmental spheres for which exposure 
to the substance is known or reasonably foreseeable, under the 
assumption that the risk management measures described in the 
exposure scenarios in the Section 5 have been implemented. In 
addition, the overall environmental risk caused by the substance shall 
be reviewed by integrating the results for the overall releases, 
emissions and losses from all sources to all environmental compartments. 
6.3. 
The risk characterisation consists of: 
— a comparison of the exposure of each human population known to be 
or likely to be exposed with the appropriate DNEL, 
— a comparison of the predicted environmental concentrations in each 
environmental sphere with the PNECs, and 
— an assessment of the likelihood and severity of an event occurring 
due to the physicochemical properties of the substance. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 114 
6.4. 
For any exposure scenario, the risk to humans and the environment can 
be considered to be adequately controlled, throughout the lifecycle of the 
substance that results from manufacture or identified uses, if: 
— the exposure levels estimated in Section 6.2 do not exceed the appro­
priate DNEL or the PNEC, as determined in Sections 1 and 3, 
respectively, and, 
— the likelihood and severity of an event occurring due to the physico­
chemical properties of the substance as determined in Section 2 is 
negligible. 
6.5. 
For those human effects and those environmental spheres for which it 
was not possible to determine a DNEL or a PNEC, a qualitative 
assessment of the likelihood that effects are avoided when implementing 
the exposure scenario shall be carried out. 
For substances satisfying the PBT and vPvB criteria, the manufacturer or 
importer shall use the information as obtained in Section 5, Step 2 when 
implementing on its site, and recommending for downstream users, risk 
management measures which minimise exposures and emissions to 
humans and the environment, throughout the lifecycle of the substance 
that results from manufacture or identified uses.

ANNEX II 
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COMPILATION OF SAFETY DATA 
SHEETS 
PART A 
0.1. 
Introduction 
0.1.1. 
This Annex sets out the requirements that the supplier shall fulfil for 
the compilation of a safety data sheet that is provided for a substance 
or a mixture in accordance with Article 31. 
0.1.2. 
The information on substances provided in the safety data sheet shall 
be consistent with the information in the registration and in the 
chemical safety report, where required. Where a chemical safety 
report has been completed, the relevant exposure scenario(s) shall 
be placed in an annex to the safety data sheet. 
0.1.3. 
The safety data sheet shall mention in each relevant section whether 
and which different nanoforms it covers and link the relevant safety 
information to each of those nanoforms. As provided for in Annex VI, 
the term ‘nanoform’ in this Annex refers to a nanoform or a set of 
similar nanoforms. 
0.2. 
General requirements for compiling a safety data sheet 
0.2.1. 
The safety data sheet shall enable users to take the necessary measures 
relating to protection of human health and safety at the workplace, 
and protection of the environment. The writer of the safety data sheet 
shall take into account that a safety data sheet must inform its 
audience of the hazards of a substance or a mixture and provide 
information on the safe storage, handling and disposal of the 
substance or the mixture. 
0.2.2. 
The information provided by safety data sheets shall also meet the 
requirements set out in Directive 98/24/EC. In particular, the safety 
data sheet shall enable employers to determine whether any hazardous 
chemical agents are present in the workplace and to assess any risk to 
the health and safety of workers arising from their use. 
0.2.3. 
The information in the safety data sheet shall be written in a clear and 
concise manner. The safety data sheet shall be prepared by a 
competent person who shall take into account the specific needs 
and knowledge of the user audience, as far as they are known. 
Suppliers of substances and mixtures shall ensure that such 
competent persons have received appropriate training, including 
refresher training. 
0.2.4. 
The language used in the safety data sheet shall be simple, clear and 
precise, avoiding jargon, acronyms and abbreviations. Statements such 
as ‘may be dangerous’, ‘no health effects’, ‘safe under most 
conditions of use’ or ‘harmless’ or any other statements indicating 
that the substance or mixture is not hazardous or any other statements 
that are inconsistent with the classification of that substance or 
mixture shall not be used. 
0.2.5. 
The date of compilation of the safety data sheet shall be given on the 
first page. When a safety data sheet has been revised and the new, 
revised version is provided to recipients, the changes shall be brought 
to the attention of the recipients in Section 16 of the safety data sheet, 
▼M58

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 118 
unless the changes have been indicated elsewhere. For the revised 
safety data sheets, the date of compilation, identified as ‘Revision: 
(date)’, shall appear on the first page, as well as one or more indi­
cations of which version is replaced, such as version number, revision 
number, or supersedes date. 
0.3. 
Safety data sheet format 
0.3.1. 
A safety data sheet is not a fixed length document. The length of the 
safety data sheet shall be commensurate with the hazard of the 
substance or mixture and the information available. 
0.3.2. 
All pages of a safety data sheet, including any annexes, shall be 
numbered and shall bear either an indication of the length of the 
safety data sheet (such as ‘page 1 of 3’) or an indication whether 
there is a page following (such as ‘Continued on next page’ or ‘End 
of safety data sheet’). 
0.4. 
Safety data sheet content 
The information required by this Annex shall be included in the safety 
data sheet, where applicable and available, in the relevant subsections 
set out in Part B. The safety data sheet shall not contain blank 
subsections. 
0.5. 
Other information requirements 
The inclusion of additional relevant and available information in the 
relevant subsections may be necessary in some cases in view of the 
wide range of properties of substances and mixtures. 
Additional safety and environmental information is required to address 
the needs of seafarers and other transport workers in the bulk transport 
of dangerous goods in sea-going or inland navigation bulk carriers or 
tank-vessels subject to International Maritime Organisation (IMO) or 
national regulations. Subsection 14.7 recommends the inclusion of 
basic classification information when such cargoes are transported in 
bulk according to the relevant IMO instruments. In addition, ships 
carrying oil or oil fuel, as defined in Annex I of MARPOL ( 1 ), in 
bulk or bunkering oil fuel are required, before loading, to be provided 
with a ‘material safety data sheet’ in accordance with the IMO’s 
Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) resolution ‘Recommendations 
for Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for MARPOL Annex I Oil 
Cargo and Oil Fuel’ (MSC.286(86)). Therefore, in order to have one 
harmonised safety data sheet for maritime and non-maritime use, the 
additional provisions of Resolution MSC.286(86) may be included in 
the safety data sheets, where appropriate, for marine transport of 
MARPOL Annex I cargoes and marine fuel oils. 
0.6. 
Units 
The units of measurement as set out in Council Directive 
80/181/EEC ( 2 ) shall be used.

SECTION 1: Identification of the substance/mixture and of the 
company/undertaking 
This section of the safety data sheet shall prescribe how the substance 
or mixture shall be identified and how the identified relevant uses, the 
name of the supplier of the substance or mixture and the contact detail 
information of the supplier of the substance or mixture, including an 
emergency contact, shall be provided in the safety data sheet. 
1.1. 
Product identifier 
The product identifier shall be provided in accordance with 
Article 18(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 in the case of a 
substance and in accordance with Article 18(3)(a) of Regulation 
(EC) No 1272/2008 in the case of a mixture, and as provided on 
the label in the official language(s) of the Member State(s) where 
the substance or mixture is placed on the market, unless the 
Member State(s) concerned provide(s) otherwise. 
For substances subject to registration, the product identifier shall be 
consistent with that provided in the registration and the registration 
number assigned under Article 20(3) of this Regulation shall also be 
indicated. Additional identifiers may be provided even if they have 
not been used in the registration. 
Without affecting the obligations of downstream users laid down in 
Article 39 of this Regulation, the part of the registration number

(j) aspiration hazard. 
These hazards shall always be listed on the safety data sheet. 
For substances subject to registration, brief summaries of the 
information derived from the application of Annexes VII to XI 
shall be given, including, where appropriate, a reference to the test 
methods used. For substances subject to registration, the information 
shall also include the result of the comparison of the available data 
with the criteria given in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 for CMR, 
categories 1A and 1B, following point 1.3.1 of Annex I to this 
Regulation. 
11.1.1. 
Information shall be provided for each hazard class or differentiation. 
If it is stated that the substance or mixture is not classified for a 
particular hazard class or differentiation, the safety data sheet shall 
clearly state whether this is due to lack of data, technical impossibility 
to obtain the data, inconclusive data or data which are conclusive 
although insufficient for classification; in the latter case the safety 
data sheet shall specify ‘based on available data, the classification 
criteria are not met’. 
11.1.2. 
The data included in this subsection shall apply to the substance or 
mixture as placed on the market. In the case of a mixture, the data 
should describe the toxicological properties of the mixture as a whole, 
except if Article 6(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 applies. If 
available, the relevant toxicological properties of the hazardous 
substances in a mixture shall also be provided, such as the LD50, 
acute toxicity estimates or LC50. 
11.1.3. 
Where there is a substantial amount of test data on the substance or 
mixture, it may be necessary to summarise results of the critical 
studies used, for example, by route of exposure. 
11.1.4. 
Where the classification criteria for a particular hazard class are not 
met, information supporting this conclusion shall be provided. 
11.1.5. 
Information on likely routes of exposure 
Information shall be provided on likely routes of exposure and the 
effects of the substance or mixture via each possible route of 
exposure, that is, through ingestion (swallowing), inhalation or 
skin/eye exposure. If health effects are not known, this shall be stated. 
▼M58

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 143 
11.1.6. 
Symptoms related to the physical, chemical and toxicological charac­
teristics 
Potential adverse health effects and symptoms associated with 
exposure to the substance or mixture and its ingredients or known 
by-products shall be described. Available information shall be 
provided on the symptoms related to the physical, chemical, and 
toxicological characteristics of the substance or mixture following 
exposure. The first symptoms at low exposures through to the 
consequences of severe exposure shall be described, such as 
‘headaches and dizziness may occur, proceeding to fainting or uncon­
sciousness; large doses may result in coma and death’. 
11.1.7. 
Delayed and immediate effects as well as chronic effects from short 
and long-term exposure 
Information shall be provided on whether delayed or immediate 
effects can be expected after short- or long-term exposure. 
Information on acute and chronic health effects relating to human 
exposure to the substance or mixture shall also be provided. Where 
human data are not available, information on the experimental data 
shall be summarised, with details on either animal data and the 
species clearly identified or the in vitro tests and the cell types 
clearly identified. It shall be indicated whether toxicological data is 
based on human or animal data or on in vitro tests. 
11.1.8. 
Interactive effects 
Information on interactions shall be included if relevant and available. 
11.1.9. 
Absence of specific data 
It may not always be possible to obtain information on the hazards of 
a substance or mixture. In cases where data on the specific substance 
or mixture are not available, data on similar substances or mixtures, if 
appropriate, may be used, provided the relevant similar substance or 
mixture is identified. Where specific data are not used, or where data 
are not available, this shall be clearly stated. 
11.1.10. 
Mixtures 
For a given health effect, if a mixture has not been tested for its 
health effects as a whole, relevant information on relevant substances 
listed under section 3 shall be provided. 
11.1.11. 
Mixture versus substance information 
11.1.11.1. The substances in a mixture may interact with each other in the body, 
resulting in different rates of absorption, metabolism and excretion. 
As a result, the toxic actions may be altered and the overall toxicity 
of the mixture may be different from that of the substances in it. This 
shall be taken into account when providing toxicological information 
in this subsection of the safety data sheet. 
11.1.11.2. It is necessary to consider whether the concentration of each 
substance is sufficient to contribute to the overall health effects of 
the mixture. The information on toxic effects shall be presented for 
each substance, except for the following cases: 
(a) if the information is duplicated, it shall be listed only once for the 
mixture overall, such as when two substances both cause 
vomiting and diarrhoea; 
▼M58

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 144 
(b) if it is unlikely that these effects will occur at the concentrations 
present, such as when a mild irritant is diluted to below a certain 
concentration in a non-irritant solution; 
(c) where information on interactions between substances in a 
mixture is not available, assumptions shall not be made and 
instead the health effects of each substance shall be listed separ­
ately. 
11.2 
Information on other hazards 
11.2.1. 
Endocrine disrupting properties 
Information on adverse health effects caused by endocrine disrupting 
properties shall be provided, where available, for the substances 
identified as having endocrine disrupting properties in Subsection

transport. If it is stated that a particular property does not apply 
(because the available data shows that the substance or mixture 
does not meet the criteria for classification) or if information on a 
particular property is not available, the reasons shall be indicated. 
Additionally, if a substance or mixture is not classified for other 
reasons (for example, due to the technical impossibility of obtaining 
the data or to inconclusive data) this should be clearly stated on the 
safety data sheet. 
Some properties are substance specific, i.e. bioaccumulation, 
persistence and degradability, and that information shall be given, 
where available and appropriate, for each relevant substance in the 
mixture (i.e. those which are required to be listed in section 3 of the 
safety data sheet and are hazardous to the environment or PBT/vPvB 
– substances). Information shall also be provided for hazardous trans­
formation products arising from the degradation of substances and 
mixtures.

ANNEX VI 
INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 10 
▼M51 
NOTE ON FULFILLING THE REQUIREMENTS OF ANNEXES VI TO XI 
Annexes VI to XI specify the information that shall be submitted for registration 
and evaluation purposes according to Articles 10, 12, 13, 40, 41 and 46. For the 
lowest tonnage level, the standard requirements are in Annex VII, and every time 
a new tonnage level is reached, the requirements of the corresponding Annex 
have to be added. For each registration the precise information requirements will 
differ, according to tonnage, use, and exposure. The Annexes shall thus be 
considered as a whole, and in conjunction with the overall requirements of 
registration, evaluation and the duty of care. 
A substance is defined in accordance with Article 3(1) and identified in 
accordance with section 2 in this Annex. A substance is always manufactured 
or imported in at least one form. A substance can also occur in more than one 
form. 
For all nanoforms covered by the registration certain specific information items 
shall be provided. Nanoforms shall be characterised as provided for in this 
Annex. The registrant shall justify why the information provided in the joint 
registration, covering the information requirements for the registered substances 
with nanoforms, is adequate for assessing the nanoforms. Information relevant to 
cover information requirements for such a substance can also be submitted 
separately by individual registrants, where justified in accordance with 
Article 11(3). 
More than one dataset may be required for one or more information requirements 
whenever there are significant differences in the properties relevant for the 
hazard, exposure and risk assessment and management of nanoforms. The 
information shall be reported in such a manner that it is clear which information 
in the joint submission pertains to which nanoform of the substance. 
Where technically and scientifically justified, the methodologies set out in Annex 
XI.1.5 shall be used within a registration dossier when two or more forms of a 
substance are ‘grouped’ for the purposes of one, more or possibly all the 
information requirements. 
The requirements specific to nanoforms apply without prejudice to requirements 
applicable to other forms of a substance. 
Definition of a nanoform and a set of similar nanoforms: 
On the basis of the Commission Recommendation of 18 October 2011 on the 
definition of nanomaterial ( 1 ), a nanoform is a form of a natural or manufactured 
substance containing particles, in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an 
agglomerate and where, for 50 % or more of the particles in the number size 
distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range 1 nm-100 nm, 
including also by derogation fullerenes, graphene flakes and single wall carbon 
nanotubes with one or more external dimensions below 1 nm. 
For this purpose, ‘particle’ means a minute piece of matter with defined physical 
boundaries; ‘agglomerate’ means a collection of weakly bound particles or 
aggregates where the resulting external surface area is similar to the sum of 
the surface areas of the individual components and ‘aggregate’ means a 
particle comprising of strongly bound or fused particles. 
▼C1 
( 1 ) OJ L 275, 20.10.2011, p. 38.

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 159 
A nanoform shall be characterised in accordance with section 2.4 below. A 
substance may have one or more different nanoforms, based on differences in 
the parameters in points 2.4.2 to 2.4.5. 
A ‘set of similar nanoforms’ is a group of nanoforms characterised in accordance 
with section 2.4 where the clearly defined boundaries in the parameters in the 
points 2.4.2 to 2.4.5 of the individual nanoforms within the set still allow to 
conclude that the hazard assessment, exposure assessment and risk assessment of 
these nanoforms can be performed jointly. A justification shall be provided to 
demonstrate that a variation within these boundaries does not affect the hazard 
assessment, exposure assessment and risk assessment of the similar nanoforms in 
the set. A nanoform can only belong to one set of similar nanoforms 
The term ‘nanoform’, when it is referred to in the other Annexes, shall refer to a 
nanoform or a set of similar nanoforms, when one has been defined, as defined 
in this Annex. 
STEP 1 — GATHER AND SHARE EXISTING INFORMATION 
The registrant should gather all existing available test data on the substance to be 
registered, this would include a literature search for relevant information on the 
substance. 
Wherever practicable, registrations should be submitted jointly, in accordance 
with Articles 11 or 19. This will enable test data to be shared, thereby 
avoiding unnecessary testing and reducing costs. The registrant should also 
collect all other available and relevant information on the substance including 
on all nanoforms of the substance that are covered by the registration, regardless 
whether testing for a given endpoint is required or not at the specific tonnage 
level. This should include information from alternative sources (e.g. from 
(Q)SARs, read-across from other substances, in vivo and in vitro testing, 
epidemiological data) which may assist in identifying the presence or absence 
of hazardous properties of the substance and which can in certain cases replace 
the results of animal tests. 
In addition, information on exposure, use and risk management measures in 
accordance with article 10 and this Annex should be collected. Considering all 
this information together, the registrant will be able to determine the need to 
generate further information. 
▼C1 
STEP 2 — CONSIDER INFORMATION NEEDS 
The registrant shall identify what information is required for the registration. 
First, the relevant Annex or Annexes to be followed shall be identified, 
according to tonnage. These Annexes set out the standard information require­
ments, but shall be considered in conjunction with Annex XI, which allows 
variation from the standard approach, where it can be justified. In particular, 
information on exposure, use and risk management measures shall be considered 
at this stage in order to determine the information needs for the substance. 
▼M51 
STEP 3 — IDENTIFY INFORMATION GAPS 
The registrant shall then compare the information needs for the substance with 
the information already available and the extent to which currently available 
information can be applied to all nanoforms covered by the registration and 
identify where there are gaps. 
It is important at this stage to ensure that the available data is relevant and has 
sufficient quality to fulfil the requirements. 
▼M51

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 160 
STEP 4 — GENERATE NEW DATA/PROPOSE TESTING STRATEGY 
In some cases it will not be necessary to generate new data. However, where 
there is an information gap that needs to be filled, new data shall be generated 
(Annexes VII and VIII), or a testing strategy shall be proposed (Annexes IX and 
X), depending on the tonnage. New tests on vertebrates shall only be conducted 
or proposed as a last resort when all other data sources have been exhausted. 
The above approach shall also apply if there is a gap of available information for 
one or more nanoforms of the substance included in the jointly submitted regis­
tration dossier. 
In some cases, the rules set out in Annexes VII to XI may require certain tests to 
be undertaken earlier than or in addition to the standard requirements. 
NOTES 
Note 1: If it is not technically possible, or if it does not appear scientifically 
necessary to give information, the reasons shall be clearly stated, in accordance 
with the relevant provisions. 
Note 2: The registrant may wish to declare that certain information submitted in 
the registration dossier is commercially sensitive and its disclosure might harm 
him commercially. If this is the case, he shall list the items and provide a 
justification.

ANNEX VII 
STANDARD INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBSTANCES 
MANUFACTURED OR IMPORTED IN QUANTITIES OF ONE TONNE 
OR MORE ( 1 ) 
Column 1 of this Annex establishes the standard information required for: 
(a) non-phase-in substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 1 to 10 
tonnes; 
(b) phase-in substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 1 to 10 tonnes 
and meeting the criteria in Annex III in accordance with Article 12(1)(a) and 
(b); and 
(c) substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 10 tonnes or more. 
Any other relevant physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological 
information that is available shall be provided. For substances not meeting the 
criteria in Annex III only the physicochemical requirements as set out in section 
7 of this Annex are required. 
Column 2 of this Annex lists specific rules according to which the required 
standard information may be omitted, replaced by other information, provided 
at a different stage or adapted in another way. If the conditions are met under 
which column 2 of this Annex allows adaptations, the registrant shall clearly 
state this fact and the reasons for each adaptation under the appropriate headings 
in the registration dossier. 
▼M51 
Without prejudice to the information submitted for other forms, any relevant 
physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological information shall include 
characterisation of the nanoform tested and test conditions. A justification shall 
be provided where QSARs are used or evidence is obtained by means other than 
testing, as well as a description of the range of the characteristics/properties of 
the nanoforms to which the evidence can be applied. 
▼C1 
In addition to these specific rules, a registrant may adapt the required standard 
information set out in column 1 of this Annex according to the general rules 
contained in Annex XI with the exception of Section 3 on substance-tailored 
exposure waiving. In this case as well, he shall clearly state the reasons for any 
decision to adapt the standard information under the appropriate headings in the 
registration dossier referring to the appropriate specific rule(s) in column 2 or in 
Annex XI ( 2 ). 
Before new tests are carried out to determine the properties listed in this Annex, 
all available in vitro data, in vivo data, historical human data, data from valid 
(Q)SARs and data from structurally related substances (read-across approach) 
shall be assessed first. In vivo testing with corrosive substances at concen­
tration/dose levels causing corrosivity shall be avoided. Prior to testing, further 
guidance on testing strategies should be consulted in addition to this Annex. 
▼M64 
Where a test method offers flexibility in the study design, for example in relation 
to the choice of dose levels, the chosen study design shall ensure that the data 
generated are adequate for hazard identification and risk assessment. To this end, 
▼C1 
( 1 ) This Annex shall apply to producers of articles that are required to register in accordance 
with Article 7 and to other downstream users that are required to carry out tests under 
this Regulation adapted as necessary. 
( 2 ) Note: conditions for not requiring a specific test that are set out in the appropriate test 
methods in the Commission Regulation on test methods as specified in Article 13(3) that 
are not repeated in column 2, also apply.

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 167 
testing shall be performed at appropriately high dose levels. If dose (concen­
tration) selection is limited by the physicochemical properties or biological 
effects of the test substance, justification shall be provided. 
▼C1 
When, for certain endpoints, information is not provided for other reasons than 
those mentioned in column 2 of this Annex or in Annex XI, this fact and the 
reasons shall also be clearly stated.

20 °C and 101,3 kPa 
7.2. 
Melting/freezing point 
7.2. 
The study does not need to be conducted below a 
lower limit of - 20 °C. 
7.3. 
Boiling point 
7.3. 
The study does not need to be conducted: 
— for gases, or 
— for solids which either melt above 300 °C or 
decompose before boiling. In such cases the 
boiling point under reduced pressure may be 
estimated or measured, or 
— for substances which decompose before boiling 
(e.g. auto-oxidation, rearrangement, degradation, 
decomposition, etc.). 
7.4. 
Relative density 
7.4. 
The study does not need to be conducted if: 
— the substance is only stable in solution in a 
particular solvent and the solution density is 
similar to that of the solvent. In such cases, an 
indication of whether the solution density is 
higher or lower than the solvent density is suffi­
cient, or 
— the substance is a gas. In this case, an estimation 
based on calculation shall be made from its 
molecular weight and the Ideal Gas Laws. 
7.5. 
Vapour pressure 
7.5. 
The study does not need to be conducted if the 
melting point is above 300 °C. 
If the melting point is between 200 °C and 300 °C, a 
limit value based on measurement or a recognised 
calculation method is sufficient.

— the substance is hydrolytically unstable at pH 4, 7 
and 9 (half-life less than 12 hours), or 
— the substance is readily oxidisable in water. 
If the substance appears ‘insoluble’ in water, a limit 
test up to the detection limit of the analytical method 
shall be performed.

The study does not need to be conducted if the 
substance is inorganic. If the test cannot be 
performed (e.g. the substance decomposes, has a 
high surface activity, reacts violently during the 
performance of the test or does not dissolve in 
water or in octanol, or it is not possible to obtain a 
sufficiently pure substance), a calculated value for 
log P as well as details of the calculation method 
shall be provided. 
For nanoforms the potential confounding effect of 
dispersion in octanol and water shall be assessed 
when conducting the study. 
For nanoforms, whether of inorganic or organic 
substances, for which the partition coefficient n- 
octanol/water is not applicable the study of 
dispersion stability shall be considered instead. 
▼C1 
7.9. 
Flash-point 
7.9. 
The study does not need to be conducted if: 
— the substance is inorganic, or 
— the substance only contains volatile organic 
components with flash-points above 100 °C for 
aqueous solutions, or 
— the estimated flash-point is above 200 °C, or 
— the flash-point can be accurately predicted by 
interpolation 
from 
existing 
characterised 
materials. 
7.10. Flammability 
7.10. The study does not need to be conducted: 
— if the substance is a solid which possesses 
explosive or pyrophoric properties. These prop­
erties should always be considered before 
considering flammability, or 
— for gases, if the concentration of the flammable 
gas in a mixture with inert gases is so low that, 
when mixed with air, the concentration is all time 
below the lower limit, or 
— for substances which spontaneously ignite when 
in contact with air. 
7.11. Explosive properties 
7.11. The study does not need to be conducted if: 
— there are no chemical groups associated with 
explosive properties present in the molecule, or 
— the substance contains chemical groups associ- 
ated with explosive properties which include 
oxygen and the calculated oxygen balance is 
less than -200, or

— the organic substance or a homogenous mixture 
of organic substances contains chemical groups 
associated with explosive properties, but the 
exothermic decomposition energy is less than 
500 J/g and the onset of exothermic decom­
position is below 500 °C, or 
— for mixtures of inorganic oxidising substances 
(UN Division 5.1) with organic materials, the 
concentration 
of 
the 
inorganic 
oxidising 
substance is: 
— less than 15 %, by mass, if assigned to UN 
Packaging Group I (high hazard) or II 
(medium hazard), 
— less than 30 %, by mass, if assigned to UN 
Packaging Group III (low hazard). 
Note: Neither a test for propagation of detonation nor 
a test for sensitivity to detonative shock is required if 
the exothermic decomposition energy of organic 
materials is less than 800 J/g. 
7.12. Self-ignition temperature 
7.12. The study does not need to be conducted: 
— if the substance is explosive or ignites sponta­
neously with air at room temperature, or 
— for liquids non flammable in air, e.g. no flash 
point up to 200 °C, or 
— for gases having no flammable range, or 
— for solids, if the substance has a melting point ≤ 
160 °C, or if preliminary results exclude self- 
heating of the substance up to 400 °C. 
7.13. Oxidising properties 
7.13. The study does not need to be conducted if: 
— the substance is explosive, or 
— the substance is highly flammable, or 
— the substance is an organic peroxide, or 
— the substance is incapable of reacting exother­
mically with combustible materials, for example 
on the basis of the chemical structure (e.g. 
organic substances not containing oxygen or 
halogen atoms and these elements are not 
chemically bonded to nitrogen or oxygen, or 
inorganic substances not containing oxygen or 
halogen atoms). 
The full test does not need to be conducted for solids 
if the preliminary test clearly indicates that the test 
substance has oxidising properties. 
Note that as there is no test method to determine the 
oxidising 
properties of gaseous 
mixtures, the 
evaluation of these properties must be realised by 
an estimation method based on the comparison of 
the oxidising potential of gases in a mixture with 
that of the oxidising potential of oxygen in air. 
7.14. Granulometry 
7.14. The study does not need to be conducted if the 
substance is marketed or used in a non solid or 
granular form.

STANDARD INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBSTANCES 
MANUFACTURED OR IMPORTED IN QUANTITIES OF 10 TONNES 
OR MORE ( 1 ) 
Column 1 of this Annex establishes the standard information required for all 
substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 10 tonnes or more in 
accordance with Article 12(1)(c). Accordingly, the information required in 
column 1 of this Annex is additional to that required in column 1 of Annex 
VII. Any other relevant physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological 
information that is available shall be provided. Column 2 of this Annex lists 
specific rules according to which the required standard information may be 
omitted, replaced by other information, provided at a different stage or adapted 
in another way. If the conditions are met under which column 2 of this Annex 
allows adaptations, the registrant shall clearly state this fact and the reasons for 
each adaptation under the appropriate headings in the registration dossier. 
▼M51 
Without prejudice to the information submitted for other forms, any relevant 
physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological information shall include 
characterisation of the nanoform tested and test conditions. A justification shall 
be provided where QSARs are used or evidence is obtained by means other than 
testing, as well as a description of the range of the characteristics/properties of 
the nanoforms to which the evidence can be applied. 
▼C1 
In addition to these specific rules, a registrant may adapt the required standard 
information set out in column 1 of this Annex according to the general rules 
contained in Annex XI. In this case as well, he shall clearly state the reasons for 
any decision to adapt the standard information under the appropriate headings in 
the registration dossier referring to the appropriate specific rule(s) in column 2 or 
in Annex XI ( 2 ). 
Before new tests are carried out to determine the properties listed in this Annex, 
all available in vitro data, in vivo data, historical human data, data from valid 
(Q)SARs and data from structurally related substances (read-across approach) 
shall be assessed first. In vivo testing with corrosive substances at concen­
tration/dose levels causing corrosivity shall be avoided. Prior to testing, further 
guidance on testing strategies should be consulted in addition to this Annex. 
▼M64 
Where a test method offers flexibility in the study design, for example in relation 
to the choice of dose levels, the chosen study design shall ensure that the data 
generated are adequate for hazard identification and risk assessment. To this end, 
testing shall be performed at appropriately high dose levels. If dose (concen­
tration) selection is limited by the physicochemical properties or biological 
effects of the test substance, justification shall be provided.

When, for certain endpoints, information is not provided for other reasons than 
those mentioned in column 2 of this Annex or in Annex XI, this fact and the reasons 
shall also be clearly stated.

— toxicity of particular concern (e.g. serious/ 
severe effects), or 
— indications of an effect for which the avail- 
able evidence is inadequate for toxicological 
and/or risk characterisation. In such cases it 
may also be more appropriate to perform 
specific toxicological studies that are de- 
signed to investigate these effects (e.g. 
immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and in parti-

9.3.1. 
The study does not need to be conducted if: 
— based on the physicochemical properties the substance can 
be expected to have a low potential for adsorption (e.g. 
the substance has a low octanol-water partition coef­
ficient), or 
— the substance and its relevant degradation products 
decompose rapidly. 
►M64 The study may not be waived on the basis of low 
octanol-water partition coefficient alone, unless the adsorptive 
properties of the substance are solely driven by lipophilicity. 
For instance, the study may not be waived on the basis of low 
octanol-water partition coefficient alone if the substance is 
surface active or ionisable at environmental pH (pH 4 – 9). ◄ 
For nanoforms, use of any physicochemical property (e.g. 
octanol-water partition coefficient) as a reason for waiving 
the study shall include adequate justification of its relevance 
to low potential for adsorption.

ANNEX IX 
STANDARD INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBSTANCES 
MANUFACTURED OR IMPORTED IN QUANTITIES OF 100 TONNES 
OR MORE ( 1 ) 
At the level of this Annex, the registrant must submit a proposal and a time 
schedule for fulfilling the information requirements of this Annex in accordance 
with Article 12(1)(d). 
Column 1 of this Annex establishes the standard information required for all 
substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 100 tonnes or more in 
accordance with Article 12(1)(d). Accordingly, the information required in 
column 1 of this Annex is additional to that required in column 1 of Annexes 
VII and VIII. Any other relevant physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxico­
logical information that is available shall be provided. Column 2 of this Annex 
lists specific rules according to which the registrant may propose to omit the 
required standard information, replace it by other information, provide it at a later 
stage or adapt it in another way. If the conditions are met under which column 2 
of this Annex allows an adaptation to be proposed, the registrant shall clearly 
state this fact and the reasons for proposing each adaptation under the appropriate 
headings in the registration dossier. 
▼M51 
Without prejudice to the information submitted for other forms, any relevant 
physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological information shall include 
characterisation of the nanoform tested and test conditions. A justification shall 
be provided where QSARs are used or evidence is obtained by means other than 
testing, as well as a description of the range of the characteristics/properties of 
the nanoforms to which the evidence can be applied. 
▼C1 
In addition to these specific rules, a registrant may propose to adapt the required 
standard information set out in column 1 of this Annex according to the general 
rules contained in Annex XI. In this case as well, he shall clearly state the 
reasons for any decision to propose adaptations to the standard information 
under the appropriate headings in the registration dossier referring to the appro­
priate specific rule(s) in column 2 or in Annex XI ( 2 ). 
Before new tests are carried out to determine the properties listed in this Annex, 
all available in vitro data, in vivo data, historical human data, data from valid 
(Q)SARs and data from structurally related substances (read-across approach) 
shall be assessed first. In vivo testing with corrosive substances at concen­
tration/dose levels causing corrosivity shall be avoided. Prior to testing, further 
guidance on testing strategies should be consulted in addition to this Annex. 
▼M64 
Where a test method offers flexibility in the study design, for example in relation 
to the choice of dose levels, the chosen study design shall ensure that the data 
generated are adequate for hazard identification and risk assessment. To this end, 
testing shall be performed at appropriately high dose levels. If dose (concen­
tration) selection is limited by the physicochemical properties or biological 
effects of the test substance, justification shall be provided. 
▼C1 
( 1 ) This Annex shall apply to producers of articles that are required to register in accordance 
with Article 7 and to other downstream users that are required to carry out tests under 
this Regulation adapted as necessary. 
( 2 ) Note: conditions for not requiring a specific test that are set out in the appropriate test 
methods in the Commission Regulation on test methods as specified in Article 13(3) that 
are not repeated in column 2, also apply.

— the substance is unreactive, insoluble and 
not inhalable and there is no evidence of 
absorption and no evidence of toxicity in 
a 28-day ‘limit test’, particularly if such a 
pattern is coupled with limited human 
exposure. 
The appropriate route shall be chosen on the 
following basis: 
Testing by the dermal route is appropriate if: 
(1) skin contact in production and/or use is 
likely; and 
(2) the physicochemical properties suggest a 
significant rate of absorption through the 
skin; and 
(3) one of the following conditions is met:

dermal absorption, or 
— significant dermal toxicity or dermal 
penetration is recognised for structu- 
rally-related substances. 
Testing by the inhalation route is appropriate 
if: 
— exposure of humans via inhalation is 
likely taking into account the vapour 
pressure of the substance and/or the 
possibility of exposure to aerosols, parti- 
cles or droplets of an inhalable size. 
►M64 For nanoforms without high dissolu- 
tion rate in biological media, the study shall 
include toxicokinetic investigations on, 
among others, the recovery period and, where 
relevant, lung clearance. Toxicokinetic inves-

— toxicity of particular concern (e.g. ser- 
ious/severe effects), or 
— indications of an effect for which the 
available evidence is inadequate for 
toxicological and/or risk characterisation. 
In such cases it may also be more 
appropriate to perform specific toxicolo-

Column 1 of this Annex establishes the standard information required for all 
substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 1 000 tonnes or more in 
accordance with Article 12(1)(e). Accordingly, the information required in 
column 1 of this Annex is additional to that required in column 1 of Annexes 
VII, VIII and IX. Any other relevant physicochemical, toxicological and ecot­
oxicological information that is available shall be provided. Column 2 of this 
Annex lists specific rules according to which the registrant may propose to omit 
the required standard information, replace it by other information, provide it at a 
later stage or adapt it in another way. If the conditions are met under which 
column 2 of this Annex allows an adaptation to be proposed, the registrant shall 
clearly state this fact and the reasons for proposing each adaptation under the 
appropriate headings in the registration dossier. 
▼M51 
Without prejudice to the information submitted for other forms, any relevant 
physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological information shall include 
characterisation of the nanoform tested and test conditions. A justification shall 
be provided where QSARs are used or evidence is obtained by means other than 
testing, as well as a description of the range of the characteristics/properties of 
the nanoforms to which the evidence can be applied. 
▼C1 
In addition to these specific rules, a registrant may propose to adapt the required 
standard information set out in column 1 of this Annex according to the general 
rules contained in Annex XI. In this case as well, he shall clearly state the 
reasons for any decision to propose adaptations to the standard information 
under the appropriate headings in the registration dossier referring to the appro­
priate specific rule(s) in column 2 or in Annex XI ( 2 ). 
Before new tests are carried out to determine the properties listed in this Annex, 
all available in vitro data, in vivo data, historical human data, data from valid 
(Q)SARs and data from structurally related substances (read-across approach) 
shall be assessed first. In vivo testing with corrosive substances at concen­
tration/dose levels causing corrosivity shall be avoided. Prior to testing, further 
guidance on testing strategies should be consulted in addition to this Annex. 
▼M64 
Where a test method offers flexibility in the study design, for example in relation 
to the choice of dose levels, the chosen study design shall ensure that the data 
generated are adequate for hazard identification and risk assessment. To this end, 
▼C1 
( 1 ) This Annex shall apply to producers of articles that are required to register in accordance 
with Article 7 and to other downstream users that are required to carry out tests under 
this Regulation adapted as necessary. 
( 2 ) Note: conditions for not requiring a specific test that are set out in the appropriate test 
methods in the Commission Regulation on test methods as specified in Article 13(3) that 
are not repeated in column 2, also apply.

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 198 
testing shall be performed at appropriately high dose levels. If dose (concen­
tration) selection is limited by the physicochemical properties or biological 
effects of the test substance, justification shall be provided. 
▼C1 
When, for certain endpoints, it is proposed not to provide information for other 
reasons than those mentioned in column 2 of this Annex or in Annex XI, this 
fact and the reasons shall also be clearly stated.

to be conducted in any of the following cases: 
— the substance is known to cause germ cell mutagenicity, 
meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class 
germ cell mutagenicity category 1A or 1B, and appro­

A long-term repeated toxicity study (≥ 12 months) may be 
proposed by the registrant or required by the Agency in 
accordance with Articles 40 or 41 if the frequency and 
duration of human exposure indicates that a longer term 
study is appropriate and one of the following conditions is 
met: 
— serious or severe toxicity effects of particular concern 
were observed in the 28-day or 90-day study for which 
the available evidence is inadequate for toxicological 
evaluation or risk characterisation, or 
— effects shown in substances with a clear relationship in 
molecular structure with the substance being studied 
were not detected in the 28-day or 90-day study, or 
— the substance may have a dangerous property that 
cannot be detected in a 90-day study. 
If nanoforms are covered by the registration, physico­
chemical characteristics, in particular particle size, shape 
and other morphological parameters, surface functional­
isation and surface area, as well as molecular structure 
shall be taken into consideration when determining if 
one of the conditions above are met.

8.6.4. 
Further studies shall be proposed by the registrant or may 
be required by the Agency in accordance with Articles 40 
or 41 in case of: 
— toxicity of particular concern (e.g. serious/severe 
effects), or 
— indications of an effect for which the available evidence 
is inadequate for toxicological evaluation and/or risk 
characterisation. In such cases it may also be more 
appropriate to perform specific toxicological studies 
that are designed to investigate these effects (e.g. 
immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity), or 
— particular concern regarding exposure (e.g. use in 
consumer products leading to exposure levels which 
are close to the dose levels at which toxicity is 
observed).

GENERAL RULES FOR ADAPTATION OF THE STANDARD TESTING 
REGIME SET OUT IN ANNEXES VII TO X 
Annexes VII to X set out the information requirements for all substances manu­
factured or imported in quantities of: 
— one tonne or more in accordance with Article 12(1)(a), 
— 10 tonnes or more in accordance with Article 12(1)(c), 
— 100 tonnes or more in accordance with Article 12(1)(d), and 
— 1 000 tonnes or more in accordance with Article 12(1)(e). 
In addition to the specific rules set out in column 2 of Annexes VII to X, a 
registrant may adapt the standard testing regime in accordance with the general 
rules set out in Section 1 of this Annex. Under dossier evaluation the Agency 
may assess these adaptations to the standard testing regime. 
▼M51 
The requirements specific to nanoforms in this Annex are without prejudice to 
requirements applicable to other forms of a substance. 
▼C1 
1. 
TESTING DOES NOT APPEAR SCIENTIFICALLY NECESSARY 
1.1. 
Use of existing data 
▼M64 
Any data generated as from 1 June 2008 shall not be considered as 
existing data and shall not be subject to the general rules for adaptation 
laid down in this point (1.1). 
1.1.1. Data on physical-chemical properties from experiments not carried out 
according to the test methods referred to in Article 13(3) 
▼C1 
Data shall be considered to be equivalent to data generated by the 
corresponding test methods referred to in Article 13(3) if the following 
conditions are met: 
(1) adequacy for the purpose of classification and labelling and/or risk 
assessment; 
(2) sufficient documentation is provided to assess the adequacy of the 
study; and 
(3) the data are valid for the endpoint being investigated and the study is 
performed using an acceptable level of quality assurance. 
1.1.2. Data on human health and environmental properties from experiments 
not carried out according to GLP or the test methods referred to in 
Article 13(3) 
Data shall be considered to be equivalent to data generated by the 
corresponding test methods referred to in Article 13(3) if the following 
conditions are met: 
(1) adequacy for the purpose of classification and labelling and/or risk 
assessment; 
(2) adequate and reliable coverage of the key parameters foreseen to be 
investigated in the corresponding test methods referred to in 
Article 13(3); 
(3) exposure duration comparable to or longer than the corresponding test 
methods referred to in Article 13(3) if exposure duration is a relevant 
parameter; and 
(4) adequate and reliable documentation of the study is provided. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 206 
1.1.3. Historical human data 
Historical human data, such as epidemiological studies on exposed popu­
lations, accidental or occupational exposure data and clinical studies, shall 
be considered. 
The strength of the data for a specific human health effect depends, 
among other things, on the type of analysis and on the parameters 
covered and on the magnitude and specificity of the response and 
consequently the predictability of the effect. Criteria for assessing the 
adequacy of the data include: 
(1) the proper selection and characterisation of the exposed and control 
groups; 
(2) adequate characterisation of exposure; 
(3) sufficient length of follow-up for disease occurrence; 
(4) valid method for observing an effect; 
(5) proper consideration of bias and confounding factors; and 
(6) a reasonable statistical reliability to justify the conclusion. 
In all cases adequate and reliable documentation shall be provided. 
When nanoforms are covered by the registration the above approach shall 
address the nanoforms separately. 
1.2. 
Weight of evidence 
▼M64 
There is sufficient weight of evidence when information from several 
independent sources together enable, through a reasoned justification, a 
conclusion on the information requirement, while the information from 
each single source alone is insufficient to fulfil the information 
requirement. The justification must have regard to the information that 
would otherwise be obtained from the study that shall normally be 
performed for this information requirement. 
There may also be sufficient weight of evidence from the use of newly 
developed test methods, not yet included in the test methods referred to in 
Article 13(3), leading to a reasoned justification that they provide the 
information that would enable a conclusion on the information 
requirement. 
Weight of evidence may lead to the conclusion that a substance has or 
has not a particular property. 
If there is sufficient weight of evidence, the information requirement is 
fulfilled. Consequently, further testing on vertebrate animals shall be 
omitted and further testing not involving vertebrate animals may be 
omitted. 
In all cases, the information provided shall be adequate for the purpose of 
classification, labelling and/or risk assessment, and adequate and reliable 
documentation shall be provided, including: 
— robust study summaries of the studies used as sources of information; 
— a justification explaining why the sources of information together 
provide a conclusion on the information requirement. 
When nanoforms are covered by the registration, the above approach shall 
address the nanoforms separately. 
▼M51 
1.3. 
Qualitative or Quantitative structure-activity relationship ((Q)SAR) 
Results obtained from valid qualitative or quantitative structure-activity 
relationship models ((Q)SARs) may indicate the presence or absence of a 
certain dangerous property. Results of (Q)SARs may be used instead of 
testing when the following conditions are met: 
▼M51

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 207 
— results are derived from a (Q)SAR model whose scientific validity has 
been established, 
— the substance falls within the applicability domain of the (Q)SAR 
model, 
— results are adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling 
and/or risk assessment, and 
— adequate and reliable documentation of the applied method is 
provided. 
The Agency in collaboration with the Commission, Member States and 
interested parties shall develop and provide guidance in assessing which 
(Q)SARs will meet these conditions and provide examples. 
When nanoforms are covered by the registration the above approach shall 
address the nanoforms separately. 
▼C1 
1.4. 
In vitro methods 
Results obtained from suitable in vitro methods may indicate the presence 
of a certain dangerous property or may be important in relation to a 
mechanistic understanding, which may be important for the assessment. 
In this context, ‘suitable’ means sufficiently well developed according to 
internationally agreed test development criteria (e.g. the European Centre 
for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM)) criteria for the entry 
of a test into the prevalidation process). Depending on the potential risk, 
immediate confirmation requiring testing beyond the information foreseen 
in Annexes VII or VIII or proposed confirmation requiring testing beyond 
the information foreseen in Annexes IX or X for the respective tonnage 
level may be necessary. 
If the results obtained from the use of such in vitro methods do not 
indicate a certain dangerous property, the relevant test shall nevertheless 
be carried out at the appropriate tonnage level to confirm the negative 
result, unless testing is not required in accordance with Annexes VII to X 
or the other rules in this Annex. 
▼M51 
Such confirmation may be waived if the following conditions are met: 
(1) results are derived from an in vitro method whose scientific validity 
has been established by a validation study, according to inter­
nationally agreed validation principles; 
(2) results are adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling 
and/or risk assessment; and 
(3) adequate and reliable documentation of the applied method is 
provided. 
When nanoforms are covered by the registration the above approach in 
points (1) to (3) shall address the nanoforms separately. 
▼C1 
1.5. 
Grouping of substances and read-across approach 
▼M64 
Substances whose physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological 
properties are likely to be similar or follow a regular pattern as a result 
of structural similarity, may be considered as a group, or category, of 
substances. Application of the group concept requires that physico­
chemical properties, human health effects and environmental effects or 
environmental fate may be predicted from data for reference substance(s) 
within the group by interpolation to other substances in the group (read- 
across approach). This avoids the need to test every substance for every 
endpoint. 
▼M51

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 208 
When nanoforms are covered by the registration, the above approach shall 
address the nanoforms separately. For grouping different nanoforms of the 
same substance, the molecular structural similarities alone may not serve 
as a justification. 
If nanoforms covered by a registration are grouped or placed in a ‘cat­
egory’ with other forms, including other nanoforms, of the substance in 
the same registration the obligations above shall apply in the same 
manner. 
The similarities may be based on any of the following: 
(1) a common functional group; 
(2) the common precursors and/or the likelihood of common breakdown 
products via physical and biological processes, which result in struc­
turally similar chemicals; 
(3) a constant pattern in the changing of the potency of the properties 
across the category. 
Structural similarity for UVCB substances shall be established on the 
basis of similarities in the structures of the constituents, together with the 
concentration of these constituents and variability in the concentration of 
these constituents. If it can be demonstrated that the identification of all 
individual constituents is not technically possible or impractical, the 
structural similarity may be demonstrated by other means, to enable a 
quantitative and qualitative comparison of the actual composition 
between substances. 
If the group concept is applied, substances shall be classified and 
labelled on this basis. 
In all cases, results shall fulfil all of the following conditions: 
— be adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling and/or risk 
assessment, 
— have adequate and reliable coverage of the key parameters addressed 
in the corresponding study that shall normally be performed for a 
particular information requirement, 
— cover an exposure duration comparable to or longer than the 
corresponding study that shall normally be performed for a particular 
information requirement if exposure duration is a relevant parameter. 
In all cases, adequate and reliable documentation of the applied method 
shall be provided. Such documentation shall include: 
— a robust study summary for each source study used in the adaptation; 
— an explanation why the properties of the registered substance may be 
predicted from other substances in the group; 
— supporting information to scientifically justify such explanation for 
prediction of properties. 
▼C1 
2. 
TESTING IS TECHNICALLY NOT POSSIBLE 
Testing for a specific endpoint may be omitted, if it is technically not 
possible to conduct the study as a consequence of the properties of the 
substance: e.g. very volatile, highly reactive or unstable substances cannot 
be used, mixing of the substance with water may cause danger of fire or 
explosion or the radio-labelling of the substance required in certain 
studies may not be possible. The guidance given in the test methods 
referred to in Article 13(3), more specifically on the technical limitations

SUBSTANCE-TAILORED EXPOSURE-DRIVEN TESTING 
▼M64 
3.1. 
Testing in accordance with Section 8.7 of Annex VIII and in accordance 
with Annex IX and Annex X may be omitted, based on the exposure 
scenario(s) developed in the Chemical Safety Report. Testing in 
accordance with Section 8.6.1 of Annex VIII may be omitted only for 
registrants producing less than 100 tonnes per year per manufacturer or 
importer, based on the exposure scenario(s) developed in the Chemical 
Safety Report. 
▼M4 
3.2. 
In all cases, adequate justification and documentation shall be provided. 
The justification shall be based on a thorough and rigorous exposure 
assessment in accordance with section 5 of Annex I and shall meet any 
one of the following criteria: 
(a) the manufacturer or importer demonstrates and documents that all of 
the following conditions are fulfilled: 
(i) the results of the exposure assessment covering all relevant 
exposures throughout the life cycle of the substance demonstrate 
the absence of or no significant exposure in all scenarios of the 
manufacture and all identified uses as referred to in Annex VI 
section 3.5; 
▼M64 
(ii) a DNEL or a PNEC can be derived from results of available test 
data for the substance concerned taking full account of the 
increased uncertainty resulting from the omission of the 
information requirement, and that DNEL or PNEC is relevant 
and appropriate both to the information requirement to be 
omitted and for risk assessment purposes. For this purpose and 
without prejudice to column 2 of Sections 8.6 and 8.7 of 
Annexes IX and X, a DNEL derived from a 28-day repeated 
dose toxicity study shall not be considered appropriate to omit 
a 90-day repeated dose toxicity study, and a DNEL derived from 
a screening test for reproductive/developmental toxicity shall not 
be considered appropriate to omit a prenatal developmental 
toxicity study or an extended one-generation reproductive 
toxicity study. 
▼M4 
(iii) the comparison of the derived DNEL or PNEC with the results 
of the exposure assessment shows that exposures are always well 
below the derived DNEL or PNEC; 
(b) where the substance is not incorporated in an article the manufacturer 
or importer demonstrates and documents for all relevant scenarios that 
throughout the life cycle strictly controlled conditions as set out in 
Article 18(4)(a) to (f) apply; 
(c) where the substance is incorporated in an article in which it is perma­
nently embedded in a matrix or otherwise rigorously contained by 
technical means, it is demonstrated and documented that all of the 
following conditions are fulfilled: 
(i) the substance is not released during its life cycle; 
(ii) the likelihood that workers or the general public or the environ­
ment are exposed to the substance under normal or reasonably 
foreseeable conditions of use is negligible; and 
(iii) the substance is handled according to the conditions set out in 
Article 18(4)(a) to (f) during all manufacturing and production 
stages including the waste management of the substance during 
these stages. 
3.3. 
The specific conditions of use must be communicated through the supply 
chain in accordance with Article 31 or 32, as the case may be.

ANNEX XII 
GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR DOWNSTREAM USERS TO ASSESS 
SUBSTANCES AND PREPARE CHEMICAL SAFETY REPORTS 
▼M51 
INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this Annex is to set out how downstream users are to assess and 
document that the risks arising from the substance(s) they use are adequately 
controlled during their use for a use not covered by the Safety Data Sheet 
supplied to them and that other users further down the supply chain can 
adequately control the risks. The assessment shall cover the life-cycle of the 
substance, from its receipt by the downstream user, for his own uses and for 
his identified uses further down the supply chain. The assessment shall consider 
the use of the substance on its own, in a mixture or in an article. 
The assessment shall address all nanoforms that are covered by the registration. 
Justifications and conclusions drawn from the assessment shall be relevant to the 
nanoforms, from their receipt by the downstream user, for his own uses and for 
his identified uses further down the supply chain. 
In carrying out the chemical safety assessment and producing the Chemical 
Safety Report, the downstream user shall take account of information received 
from the supplier of the chemical in accordance with Article 31 and 32 of this 
Regulation. 
When nanoforms of the substance are covered by his own use or his identified 
uses down the supply chain, an appropriate metric for the assessment and pres­
entation of the results in steps 1- 6 of the chemical safety assessment under 0.6.1 
and 0.6.2 shall be considered, with the justification included in the chemical 
safety report and summarised in the safety data sheet. A multiple metric presen­
tation is preferable, ensuring availability of mass metric information. 
Where available and appropriate, an assessment carried out under Community 
legislation, (e.g. risk assessments completed under Regulation (EEC) No 793/93) 
shall be taken into account in the chemical safety assessment and be reflected in 
the Chemical Safety Report. Deviations from such assessments shall be justified. 
Assessments carried out under other international and national programmes may 
also be taken into account. 
The process which the downstream user goes through in carrying out the 
chemical safety assessment and in producing his Chemical Safety Report, 
involves three steps: 
▼C1 
STEP 1: DEVELOPMENT OF EXPOSURE SCENARIO(S) 
The downstream user shall develop exposure scenarios for uses not covered in a 
Safety Data Sheet supplied to him in accordance with Section 5 of Annex I. 
STEP 
2: 
IF 
NECESSARY, 
A 
REFINEMENT 
OF 
THE 
HAZARD 
ASSESSMENT BY THE SUPPLIER 
If the downstream user considers the hazard and PBT assessments reported in the 
Safety Data Sheet supplied to him to be appropriate, then no further hazard 
assessment or PBT and vPvB assessment is necessary. In this case he shall 
use the relevant information reported by the supplier for the risk characterisation. 
This shall be stated in the Chemical Safety Report. 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 211 
When nanoforms of the substance are covered by his own use or his identified 
uses down the supply chain, the assessment shall cover the hazard, PBT and 
vPvB assessment of nanoforms(s) as used. 
▼C1 
If the downstream user considers the assessments reported in the Safety Data 
Sheet supplied to him to be inappropriate, then he shall carry out the relevant 
assessments in accordance with Sections 1 to 4 of Annex I as appropriate to him. 
▼M51 
In those cases where the downstream user considers that information, in addition 
to that provided by the supplier, is necessary for producing his Chemical Safety 
Report, the downstream user shall gather this information. Where this 
information can only be obtained by testing on vertebrate animals, he shall 
submit a proposal for a testing strategy to the Agency in accordance with 
Article 38. He shall explain why he considers that additional information is 
necessary. While waiting for results of further testing, he shall record in his 
chemical safety report the risk management measures intended to manage the 
risks being explored that he has put in place. The above record taking shall 
address all nanoforms that are covered by his own uses or his identified uses 
down the supply chain. Such information shall be relevant to the nanoforms. 
▼C1 
On completion of any additional testing, the downstream user shall revise the 
Chemical Safety Report, and his Safety Data Sheet if he is required to prepare 
one, as appropriate. 
STEP 3: RISK CHARACTERISATION 
A risk characterisation shall be carried out for each new exposure scenario as 
prescribed in Section 6 of Annex I. The risk characterisation shall be presented 
under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report and summarised in the 
Safety Data Sheet under the relevant heading(s). 
When generating an exposure scenario it will be necessary to make initial 
assumptions about the operating conditions and risk managements measures. If 
the initial assumptions lead to a risk characterisation indicating inadequate 
protection of human health and the environment, then it shall be necessary to 
carry out an iterative process with amendment of one or a number of factors until 
adequate control can be demonstrated. This may require the generation of ad­
ditional hazard or exposure information or appropriate alteration of the process, 
operating conditions or risk management measures. Therefore, iterations may be 
made between on the one hand developing and revising an (initial) exposure 
scenario, which includes developing and implementing risk management 
measures, and on the other hand generating further information to produce the 
definitive exposure scenario. The purpose of generating further information is to 
establish a more precise risk characterisation, based on a refined hazard 
assessment and/or exposure assessment. 
The downstream user shall produce a Chemical Safety Report detailing his 
chemical safety assessment using Part B, Sections 9 and 10, of the format set 
out in Section 7 of Annex I and the other sections of this format, if appropriate. 
Part A of the Chemical Safety Report shall include a declaration that the risk 
management measures outlined in the relevant exposure scenarios are implemen­
ted by the downstream user for his own uses and that the risk management 
measures outlined in the exposure scenarios for the identified uses are 
communicated down the supply chain.

ANNEX XIII 
CRITERIA 
FOR 
THE 
IDENTIFICATION 
OF 
PERSISTENT, 
BIOACCUMULATIVE 
AND 
TOXIC 
SUBSTANCES, 
AND 
VERY 
PERSISTENT AND VERY BIOACCUMULATIVE SUBSTANCES 
This Annex lays down the criteria for the identification of persistent, bioaccumu­
lative and toxic substances (PBT substances), and very persistent and very bioac­
cumulative substances (vPvB substances) as well as the information that must be 
considered for the purpose of assessing the P, B, and T properties of a substance. 
For the identification of PBT substances and vPvB substances a weight-of- 
evidence determination using expert judgement shall be applied, by comparing 
all relevant and available information listed in Section 3.2 with the criteria set out 
in Section 1. This shall be applied in particular where the criteria set out in 
Section 1 cannot be applied directly to the available information. 
A weight-of-evidence determination means that all available information bearing 
on the identification of a PBT or a vPvB substance is considered together, such 
as the results of monitoring and modelling, suitable in vitro tests, relevant animal 
data, information from the application of the category approach (grouping, read- 
across), (Q)SAR results, human experience such as occupational data and data 
from accident databases, epidemiological and clinical studies and well docu­
mented case reports and observations. The quality and consistency of the data 
shall be given appropriate weight. The available results regardless of their indi­
vidual conclusions shall be assembled together in a single weight-of-evidence 
determination. 
The information used for the purposes of assessment of the PBT/vPvB properties 
shall be based on data obtained under relevant conditions. 
The identification shall also take account of the PBT/vPvB-properties of relevant 
constituents of a substance and relevant transformation and/or degradation 
products. 
This Annex shall apply to all organic substances, including organo-metals. 
1.

SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT OF P, vP, B, vB and T PROP­
ERTIES 
2.1. 
Registration 
For the identification of PBT and vPvB substances in the registration 
dossier, the registrant shall consider the information as described in 
Annex I and in Section 3 of this Annex. 
If the technical dossier contains for one or more endpoints only 
information as required in Annexes VII and VIII, the registrant shall 
consider information relevant for screening for P, B, or T properties in 
accordance with Section 3.1 of this Annex. If the result from the 
screening tests or other information indicate that the substance may 
have PBT or vPvB properties, the registrant shall generate relevant ad­
ditional information as set out in Section 3.2 of this Annex. In case the 
generation of relevant additional information would require information 
listed in Annexes IX or X, the registrant shall submit a testing proposal. 
Where the process and use conditions of the substance meet the 
conditions as specified in Section 3.2(b) or (c) of Annex XI the additional 
information may be omitted, and subsequently the substance is considered 
as if it is a PBT or vPvB in the registration dossier. No additional 
information needs to be generated for the assessment of PBT/vPvB prop­
erties if there is no indication of P or B properties following the result 
from the screening test or other information.

concern in accordance with Article 59, 
▼C1 
— restrictions of the manufacture, placing on the market or use of a 
substance within the Community. 
The relevant parts of Annex I shall be used for the methodology and 
format of any dossier according to this Annex. 
For all dossiers any relevant information from registration dossiers shall 
be considered and other available information may be used. For hazard 
information which has not been previously submitted to the Agency, a 
robust study summary shall be included in the dossier.

2. 
Dossier for the identification of a substance as a CMR, PBT, vPvB or 
a substance of equivalent concern according to Article 59 
Proposal 
The proposal shall include the identity of substance(s) concerned and 
whether it is proposed to be identified as a CMR according to 
Article 57(a), (b) or (c), a PBT according to Article 57(d), a vPvB 
according to Article 57(e), or a substance of equivalent concern 
according to Article 57(f). 
Justification 
A comparison of the available information with the criteria in Annex XIII 
for PBT according to Article 57(d), and vPvBs according to Article 57(e), 
or an assessment of the hazards and a comparison with Article 57(f), 
according to the relevant parts of Sections 1 to 4 of Annex I shall be 
completed. This shall be documented in the format set out in Part B of the 
Chemical Safety Report in Annex I.

02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 233 
Information on hazard and risk 
The risks to be addressed with the restriction shall be described based on 
an assessment of the hazard and risks according to the relevant parts of 
Annex I and shall be documented in the format set out in Part B of that 
Annex for the Chemical Safety Report. 
Evidence shall be provided that implemented risk management measures 
(including those identified in registrations under Articles 10 to 14) are not 
sufficient. 
Information on alternatives 
Available information on alternative substances and techniques shall be 
provided, including: 
— information on the risks to human health and the environment related 
to the manufacture or use of the alternatives, 
— availability, including the time scale, 
— technical and economical feasibility. 
Justification for Restrictions at Community Level 
Justification shall be provided that: 
— action is required on a Community-wide basis, 
— a restriction is the most appropriate Community wide measure which 
shall be assessed using the following criteria: 
(i) effectiveness: the restriction must be targeted to the effects or 
exposures that cause the risks identified, capable of reducing 
these risks to an acceptable level within a reasonable period of 
time and proportional to the risk; 
(ii) practicality: the restriction must be implementable, enforceable 
and manageable; 
(iii) monitorability: it must be possible to monitor the result of the 
implementation of the proposed restriction. 
Socio-economic assessment 
The socio-economic impacts of the proposed restriction may be analysed 
with reference to Annex XVI. To this end, the net benefits to human 
health and the environment of the proposed restriction may be compared 
to its net costs to manufacturers, importers, downstream users, 
distributors, consumers and society as a whole. 
Information on stakeholder consultation 
Information on any consultation of stakeholders and how their views have 
been taken into account shall be included in the dossier.

ANNEX XVI 
SOCIO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
This Annex outlines the information that may be addressed by those submitting a 
socio-economic analysis (SEA) with an application for authorisation, as specified 
in Article 62(5)(a), or in connection with a proposed restriction, as specified in 
Article 69(6)(b). 
The Agency shall prepare guidance for the preparation of SEAs. SEAs, or 
contributions to them, shall be submitted in the format specified by the 
Agency in accordance with Article 111. 
However, the level of detail and scope of the SEA, or contributions to them, shall 
be the responsibility of the applicant for authorisation, or, in the case of a 
proposed restriction, the interested party. The information provided can address 
the socio-economic impacts at any level. 
An SEA may include the following elements: 
— impact of a granted or refused authorisation on the applicant(s), or, in the 
case of a proposed restriction, the impact on industry (e.g. manufacturers and 
importers). The impact on all other actors in the supply chain, downstream 
users and associated businesses in terms of commercial consequences such as 
impact on investment, research and development, innovation, one-off and 
operating costs (e.g. compliance, transitional arrangements, changes to 
existing processes, reporting and monitoring systems, installation of new 
technology, etc.) taking into account general trends in the market and tech­
nology, 
— impacts of a granted or refused authorisation, or a proposed restriction, on 
consumers. For example, product prices, changes in composition or quality or 
performance of products, availability of products, consumer choice, as well as 
effects on human health and the environment to the extent that these affect 
consumers, 
— social implications of a granted or refused authorisation, or a proposed 
restriction. For example job security and employment, 
— availability, suitability, and technical feasibility of alternative substances 
and/or technologies, and economic consequences thereof, and information 
on the rates of, and potential for, technological change in the sector(s) 
concerned. In the case of an application for authorisation, the social and/or 
economic impacts of using any available alternatives, 
— wider implications on trade, competition and economic development (in 
particular for SMEs and in relation to third countries) of a granted or 
refused authorisation, or a proposed restriction. This may include consider­
ation of local, regional, national or international aspects, 
— in the case of a proposed restriction, proposals for other regulatory or non- 
regulatory measures that could meet the aim of the proposed restriction (this 
shall take account of existing legislation). This should include an assessment 
of the effectiveness and the costs linked to alternative risk management 
measures, 
— in the case of a proposed restriction or refused authorisation, the benefits for 
human health and the environment as well as the social and economic 
benefits of the proposed restriction. For example, worker health, environmen­
tal performance and the distribution of these benefits, for example, geographi­
cally, population groups, 
— an SEA may also address any other issue that is considered to be relevant by 
the applicant(s) or interested party.

FOREWORD 
Explanations of column headings 
Substances: 
The name corresponds to the International Chemical Identification used for the 
substance in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council on classification, labelling and 
packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 
67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. 
Whenever possible, substances are designated by their IUPAC names. Substances 
listed in Einecvs (European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical 
Substances), Elincs (European List of Notified Substances) or the list of ‘No- 
longer-polymers’ are designated using the names in these lists. Other names, such 
as usual or common names, are included in some cases. Whenever possible, plant 
protection products and biocides are designated by their ISO names. 
Entries for groups of substances: 
A number of group entries are included in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation 
(EC) No 1272/2008. In these cases, the classification requirements will apply to 
all substances covered by the description. 
In some cases, there are classification requirements for specific substances that 
would be covered by the group entry. In such cases a specific entry is included in 
Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 for the substance and the 
group entry will be annotated with the phrase ‘except those specified elsewhere 
in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008’. 
In some cases, individual substances may be covered by more than one group 
entry. In these cases, the classification of the substance reflects the classification 
for each of the two group entries. In cases where different classifications for the 
same hazard are given, the most severe classification will be applied. 
Index number: 
The Index number is the identification code given to the substance in Part 3 of 
Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. Substances are listed in the 
Appendix according to this index number. 
EC numbers: 
The EC number, i.e. Einecs, Elincs or NLP, is the official number of the 
substance within the European Union. The Einecs number can be obtained 
from the European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical Substance 
(Einecs). The Elincs number can be obtained from the European List of 
Notified Substances. The NLP number can be obtained from the list of ‘No- 
longer-polymers’. These lists are published by the Office for Official Publications 
of the European Communities. 
The EC number is a seven-digit system of the type XXX-XXX-X which starts at 
200-001-8 (Einecs), at 400-010-9 (Elincs) and at 500-001-0 (NLP). This number 
is indicated in the column entitled ‘EC No’.

02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 291 
CAS number: 
Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) numbers have been defined for substances to 
help in their identification. 
N o t e s : 
The full text of the notes can be found in Part 1 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) 
No 1272/2008. 
The notes to be taken into account for the purposes of this Regulation are the 
following: 
Note A: 
Without prejudice to Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, the name 
of the substance must appear on the label in the form of one of the designations 
given in Part 3 of Annex VI to that Regulation. 
In that Part, use is sometimes made of a general description such as ‘… 
compounds’ or ‘… salts’. In this case, the supplier who places such a 
substance on the market is required to state on the label the correct name, due 
account being taken of Section 1.1.1.4 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 
1272/2008. 
▼M14 
Note B: 
Some substances (acids, bases, etc.) are placed on the market in aqueous 
solutions at various concentrations and, therefore, these solutions require 
different classification and labelling since the hazards vary at different concen­
trations. 
▼M5 
Note C: 
Some organic substances may be marketed either in a specific isomeric form or 
as a mixture of several isomers. 
Note D: 
Certain substances which are susceptible to spontaneous polymerisation or 
decomposition are generally placed on the market in a stabilised form. It is in 
this form that they are listed in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 
1272/2008. 
However, such substances are sometimes placed on the market in a non-stabilised 
form. In this case, supplier who places such a substance on the market must state 
on the label the name of the substance followed by the words ‘non-stabilised’. 
Note J: 
The classification as a carcinogen or mutagen need not apply if it can be shown 
that the substance contains less than 0,1 % w/w benzene (EC No 200-753-7). 
Note K: 
The classification as a carcinogen or mutagen need not apply if it can be shown that 
the substance contains less than 0,1 % w/w 1,3-butadiene (EC No 203-450-8). 
Note L: 
The classification as a carcinogen need not apply if it can be shown that the 
substance contains less than 3 % DMSO extract as measured by IP 346. 
Note M: 
The classification as a carcinogen need not apply if it can be shown that the 
substance contains less than 0,005 % w/w benzo[a]-pyrene (EC No 200-028-5). 
Note N: 
The classification as a carcinogen need not apply if the full refining history is 
known and it can be shown that the substance from which it is produced is not a 
carcinogen. 
▼M5

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 292 
Note P: 
The classification as a carcinogen or mutagen need not apply if it can be shown 
that the substance contains less than 0,1 % w/w benzene (EC No 200-753-7). 
Note R: 
The classification as a carcinogen need not apply to fibres with a length weighted 
geometric mean diameter, less two standard errors, greater than 6μm.

Appendix 7 
Special provisions on the labelling of articles containing asbestos 
1. All articles containing asbestos or the packaging thereof must bear the label 
defined as follows: 
(a) the label conforming to the specimen below shall be at least 5 cm high 
(H) and 2,5 cm wide; 
(b) it shall consist of two parts: 
— the top part (h 1 = 40 % H) shall include the letter ‘a’ in white, on a 
black background, 
— the bottom part (h 2 = 60 % H) shall include the standard wording in 
white and/or black, on a red background, and shall be clearly legible; 
(c) if the article contains crocidolite, the words ‘contains asbestos’ used in 
the standard wording shall be replaced by ‘contains crocidolite/blue 
asbestos’. 
Member States may exclude from the provision of the first subparagraph 
articles intended to be placed on the market in their territory. The 
labelling of these articles must however bear the wording ‘contains 
asbestos’; 
(d) if labelling takes the form of direct printing on the articles, a single 
colour contrasting with the background colour is sufficient. 
2. The label mentioned in this Appendix shall be affixed in accordance with the 
following rules: 
(a) on each of the smallest units supplied; 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 557 
(b) if an article has asbestos-based components, it is sufficient for these 
components only to bear the label. The labelling may be dispensed 
with if smallness of size or unsuitability of packaging make it impossible 
for a label to be affixed to the component. 
3. Labelling of packaged articles containing asbestos 
3.1. The following particulars shall appear on clearly legible and indelible 
labelling on the packaging of packaged articles containing asbestos: 
(a) the symbol and relevant indications of danger in accordance with 
this Annex; 
(b) safety instructions which must be selected in accordance with the 
particulars in this Annex, inasmuch as they are relevant for the 
particular article. 
Where additional safety information is provided on the packaging, this 
shall not weaken or contradict the particulars given in accordance with 
points (a) and (b). 
3.2. Labelling in accordance with 3.1 shall be effected by means of: 
— a label firmly affixed to the packaging, or 
— a (tie-on) label securely attached to the package, or 
— direct printing of the packaging. 
3.3. Articles containing asbestos and which are packaged only in loose 
plastic wrapping or the like shall be regarded as packaged articles and 
shall be labelled in accordance with 3.2. If articles are separated from 
such packages and placed on the market unpackaged, each of the 
smallest units supplied shall be accompanied by labelling particulars 
in accordance with 3.1. 
4. Labelling of unpackaged articles containing asbestos 
For unpackaged articles containing asbestos, labelling in accordance with 3.1 
shall be effected by means of: 
— a label firmly affixed to the article containing asbestos, 
— a (tie-on) label securely attached to such an article, 
— direct printing on the articles, 
or, if the abovementioned is not reasonably practicable as in the case of, for 
example, smallness of size of the article, the unsuitable nature of the article's 
properties or certain technical difficulties by means of a hand-out with 
labelling in accordance with 3.1. 
5. Without prejudice to Community provisions on safety and hygiene at work, 
the label affixed to the article which may, in the context of its use, be 
processed or finished, shall be accompanied by any safety instructions 
which may be appropriate for the article concerned, and in particular by 
the following: 
— operate if possible out of doors or in a well-ventilated place, 
— preferably use hand tools or low-speed tools equipped, if necessary, with 
an appropriate dust-extraction facility. If high-speed tools are used, they 
should always be equipped with such a facility, 
▼C1

 
02006R1907 — EN — 17.12.2022 — 056.001 — 558 
— if possible, dampen before cutting or drilling, 
— dampen dust and place it in a properly closed receptacle and dispose of it 
safely. 
6. The labelling of any article intended for domestic use which is not covered 
by Section 5 and which is likely, during use, to release asbestos fibres shall, 
if necessary, contain the following safety instruction: ‘replace when worn’. 
7. The labelling of articles containing asbestos shall be in the official language 
or languages of the Member State(s) where the article is placed on the 
market.
