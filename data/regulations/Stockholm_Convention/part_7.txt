Notes: 
 
(i) 
Except as otherwise specified in this Convention, quantities of a chemical 
occurring as unintentional trace contaminants in products and articles shall not be 
considered to be listed in this Annex; 
 
(ii) 
This note shall not be considered as a production and use specific exemption for 
purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 3.  Quantities of a chemical occurring as 
constituents of articles manufactured or already in use before or on the date of 
entry into force of the relevant obligation with respect to that chemical, shall not 
be considered as listed in this Annex, provided that a Party has notified the 
Secretariat that a particular type of article remains in use within that Party. The 
Secretariat shall make such notifications publicly available; 
 
(iii) This note, which does not apply to a chemical that has an asterisk following its 
name in the Chemical column in Part I of this Annex, shall not be considered as a 
production and use specific exemption for purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 3. 
Given that no significant quantities of the chemical are expected to reach humans 
and the environment during the production and use of a closed-system site-limited 
intermediate, a Party, upon notification to the Secretariat, may allow the 
production and use of quantities of a chemical listed in this Annex as a closed-
system site-limited intermediate that is chemically transformed in the manufacture 
of other chemicals that, taking into consideration the criteria in paragraph 1 of 
Annex D, do not exhibit the characteristics of persistent organic pollutants.  This 
notification shall include information on total production and use of such 
chemical or a reasonable estimate of such information and information regarding 
the nature of the closed-system site-limited process including the amount of any 
non-transformed and unintentional trace contamination of the persistent organic 
pollutant-starting material in the final product.  This procedure applies except as 
otherwise specified in this Annex.  The Secretariat shall make such notifications 
available to the Conference of the Parties and to the public.  Such production or 
use shall not be considered a production or use specific exemption.  Such 
production and use shall cease after a ten-year period, unless the Party concerned 
submits a new notification to the Secretariat, in which case the period will be 
extended for an additional ten years unless the Conference of the Parties, after a 
review of the production and use decides otherwise.  The notification procedure 
can be repeated; 
 
(iv) All the specific exemptions in this Annex may be exercised by Parties that have 
registered exemptions in respect of them in accordance with Article 4 with the 
exception of the use of polychlorinated biphenyls in articles in use in accordance 
with the provisions of Part II of this Annex, which may be exercised by all 
Parties. 
 

 
26
Part II 
 
Polychlorinated biphenyls 
 
 
Each Party shall: 
 
 
(a) 
With regard to the elimination of the use of polychlorinated biphenyls in 
equipment (e.g. transformers, capacitors or other receptacles containing liquid stocks) by 
2025, subject to review by the Conference of the Parties, take action in accordance with the 
following priorities: 
 
(i) 
Make determined efforts to identify, label and remove from use equipment 
containing greater than 10 per cent polychlorinated biphenyls and volumes 
greater than 5 litres; 
 
(ii) 
Make determined efforts to identify, label and remove from use equipment 
containing greater than 0.05 per cent polychlorinated biphenyls and volumes 
greater than 5 litres; 
 
(iii) Endeavour to identify and remove from use equipment containing greater 
than 0.005 percent polychlorinated biphenyls and volumes greater than 0.05 
litres; 
 
 
(b) 
Consistent with the priorities in subparagraph (a), promote the following 
measures to reduce exposures and risk to control the use of polychlorinated biphenyls: 
 
(i) 
Use only in intact and non-leaking equipment and only in areas where the 
risk from environmental release can be minimised and quickly remedied; 
 
(ii) 
Not use in equipment in areas associated with the production or processing 
of food or feed; 
 
(iii) When used in populated areas, including schools and hospitals, all 
reasonable measures to protect from electrical failure which could result in a 
fire, and regular inspection of equipment for leaks; 
 
 
(c) 
Notwithstanding paragraph 2 of Article 3, ensure that equipment containing 
polychlorinated biphenyls, as described in subparagraph (a), shall not be exported or imported 
except for the purpose of environmentally sound waste management; 
 
 
(d) 
Except for maintenance and servicing operations, not allow recovery for the 
purpose of reuse in other equipment of liquids with polychlorinated biphenyls content above 
0.005 per cent; 
 
 
(e) 
Make determined efforts designed to lead to environmentally sound waste 
management of liquids containing polychlorinated biphenyls and equipment contaminated 
with polychlorinated biphenyls having a polychlorinated biphenyls content above 0.005 per 
cent, in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 6, as soon as possible but no later than 2028, 
subject to review by the Conference of the Parties; 
 

 
27
(f) 
In lieu of note (ii) in Part I of this Annex, endeavour to identify other articles 
containing more than 0.005 per cent polychlorinated biphenyls (e.g. cable-sheaths, cured 
caulk and painted objects) and manage them in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 6; 
 
(g) 
Provide a report every five years on progress in eliminating polychlorinated 
biphenyls and submit it to the Conference of the Parties pursuant to Article 15; 
 
(h) 
The reports described in subparagraph (g) shall, as appropriate, be considered by 
the Conference of the Parties in its reviews relating to polychlorinated biphenyls.  The 
Conference of the Parties shall review progress towards elimination of polychlorinated 
biphenyls at five year intervals or other period, as appropriate, taking into account such 
reports.
