deration of approaches to prevent the formation and 
release of the chemicals listed in Part I.  Useful measures could include: 
 
 
(a) 
The use of low-waste technology; 
 
 
(b) 
The use of less hazardous substances; 
 
 
(c) 
The promotion of the recovery and recycling of waste and of substances 
generated and used in a process; 
 
 
(d) 
Replacement of feed materials which are persistent organic pollutants or where 
there is a direct link between the materials and releases of persistent organic pollutants from 
the source; 
 
 
(e) 
Good housekeeping and preventive maintenance programmes; 
 
 
(f) 
Improvements in waste management with the aim of the cessation of open and 
other uncontrolled burning of wastes, including the burning of landfill sites.  When 
considering proposals to construct new waste disposal facilities, consideration should be 
given to alternatives such as activities to minimize the generation of municipal and medical 
waste, including resource recovery, reuse, recycling, waste separation and promoting products 
that generate less waste.   Under this approach, public health concerns should be carefully 
considered; 
 
 
(g) 
Minimization of these chemicals as contaminants in products; 
 
 
(h) 
Avoiding elemental chlorine or chemicals generating elemental chlorine for 
bleaching. 
 
B.  Best available techniques  
 
 
The concept of best available techniques is not aimed at the prescription of any specific 
technique or technology, but at taking into account the technical characteristics of the 
installation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions.  
Appropriate control techniques to reduce releases of the chemicals listed in Part I are in 
general the same.  In determining best available techniques, special consideration should be 
given, generally or in specific cases, to the following factors, bearing in mind the likely costs 
and benefits of a measure and consideration of precaution and prevention:   
  
 
(a) 
General considerations: 
 
(i) 
The nature, effects and mass of the releases concerned:  techniques may 
vary depending on source size; 
 

 
34
(ii) 
The commissioning dates for new or existing installations; 
 
(iii) The time needed to introduce the best available technique; 
 
(iv) 
The consumption and nature of raw materials used in the process and its 
energy efficiency; 
 
(v) 
The need to prevent or reduce to a minimum the overall impact of the 
releases to the environment and the risks to it; 
 
(vi) 
The need to prevent accidents and to minimize their consequences for the 
environment; 
 
(vii) The need to ensure occupational health and safety at workplaces; 
 
(viii) Comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have been 
tried with success on an industrial scale; 
 
(ix) 
Technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and 
understanding.  
 
  
(b) 
General release reduction measures:  When considering proposals to construct 
new facilities or significantly modify existing facilities using processes that release chemicals 
listed in this Annex, priority consideration should be given to alternative processes, 
techniques or practices that have similar usefulness but which avoid the formation and release 
of such chemicals.  In cases where such facilities will be constructed or significantly 
modified, in addition to the prevention measures outlined in section A of Part V the following 
reduction measures could also be considered in determining best available techniques: 
 
(i) 
Use of improved methods for flue-gas cleaning such as thermal or catalytic 
oxidation, dust precipitation, or adsorption; 
 
(ii) 
Treatment of residuals, wastewater, wastes and sewage sludge by, for 
example, thermal treatment or rendering them inert or chemical processes 
that detoxify them; 
 
(iii) Process changes that lead to the reduction or elimination of releases, such as 
moving to closed systems; 
 
(iv) Modification of process designs to improve combustion and prevent 
formation of the chemicals listed in this Annex, through the control of 
parameters such as incineration temperature or residence time. 
 
 
C.  Best environmental practices  
 
 
The Conference of the Parties may develop guidance with regard to best environmental 
practices.

Annex D 
 
INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS AND SCREENING CRITERIA  
 
1. 
A Party submitting a proposal to list a chemical in Annexes A, B and/or C shall identify 
the chemical in the manner described in subparagraph (a) and provide the information on the 
chemical, and its transformation products where relevant, relating to the screening criteria set 
out in subparagraphs (b) to (e):  
 
 
(a) 
Chemical identity: 
 
 (i) 
Names, including trade name or names, commercial name or names and 
synonyms, 
Chemical 
Abstracts 
Service 
(CAS) 
Registry 
number, 
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name; and  
 
 (ii) 
Structure, including specification of isomers, where applicable, and the 
structure of the chemical class; 
 
 
(b) 
Persistence: 
 
 (i) 
Evidence that the half-life of the chemical in water is greater than two 
months, or that its half-life in soil is greater than six months, or that its half-
life in sediment is greater than six months; or 
 
 (ii) 
Evidence that the chemical is otherwise sufficiently persistent to justify its 
consideration within the scope of this Convention; 
 
 
(c) 
Bio-accumulation: 
 
 (i) 
Evidence that the bio-concentration factor or bio-accumulation factor in 
aquatic species for the chemical is greater than 5,000 or, in the absence of 
such data, that the log Kow is greater than 5;  
 
 (ii) 
Evidence that a chemical presents other reasons for concern, such as high 
bio-accumulation in other species, high toxicity or ecotoxicity; or 
 
 (iii) Monitoring data in biota indicating that the bio-accumulation potential of 
the chemical is sufficient to justify its consideration within the scope of this 
Convention;
