STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS 
 
 
The Parties to this Convention, 
 
 
Recognizing that persistent organic pollutants possess toxic properties, resist 
degradation, bioaccumulate and are transported, through air, water and migratory species, 
across international boundaries and deposited far from their place of release, where they 
accumulate in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, 
 
 
Aware of the health concerns, especially in developing countries, resulting from local 
exposure to persistent organic pollutants, in particular impacts upon women and, through 
them, upon future generations, 
 
 
Acknowledging that the Arctic ecosystems and indigenous communities are particularly 
at risk because of the biomagnification of persistent organic pollutants and that contamination 
of their traditional foods is a public health issue, 
 
 
Conscious of the need for global action on persistent organic pollutants, 
 
 
Mindful of decision 19/13 C of 7 February 1997 of the Governing Council of the 
United Nations Environment Programme to initiate international action to protect human 
health and the environment through measures which will reduce and/or eliminate emissions 
and discharges of persistent organic pollutants, 
 
 
Recalling the pertinent provisions of the relevant international environmental 
conventions, especially the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure 
for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, and the Basel 
Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their 
Disposal including the regional agreements developed within the framework of its Article 11, 
 
 
Recalling also the pertinent provisions of the Rio Declaration on Environment and 
Development and Agenda 21, 
 
 
Acknowledging that precaution underlies the concerns of all the Parties and is 
embedded within this Convention, 
 
 
Recognizing that this Convention and other international agreements in the field of 
trade and the environment are mutually supportive, 
 
 
Reaffirming that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and 
the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources 
pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and the responsibility to 
ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the 
environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, 
 
 
Taking into account the circumstances and particular requirements of developing 
countries, in particular the least developed among them, and countries with economies in 
transition, especially the need to strengthen their national capabilities for the management of 
chemicals, including through the transfer of technology, the provision of financial and 
technical assistance and the promotion of cooperation among the Parties, 
 

 
2
 
Taking full account of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of 
Small Island Developing States, adopted in Barbados on 6 May 1994, 
 
 
Noting the respective capabilities of developed and developing countries, as well as the 
common but differentiated responsibilities of States as set forth in Principle 7 of the Rio 
Declaration on Environment and Development, 
 
 
Recognizing the important contribution that the private sector and non-governmental 
organizations can make to achieving the reduction and/or elimination of emissions and 
discharges of persistent organic pollutants, 
 
 
Underlining the importance of manufacturers of persistent organic pollutants taking 
responsibility for reducing adverse effects caused by their products and for providing 
information to users, Governments and the public on the hazardous properties of those 
chemicals, 
 
 
Conscious of the need to take measures to prevent adverse effects caused by persistent 
organic pollutants at all stages of their life cycle, 
 
 
Reaffirming Principle 16 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 
which states that national authorities should endeavour to promote the internalization of 
environmental costs and the use of economic instruments, taking into account the approach 
that the polluter should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution, with due regard to the public 
interest and without distorting international trade and investment, 
 
 
Encouraging Parties not having regulatory and assessment schemes for pesticides and 
industrial chemicals to develop such schemes, 
 
 
Recognizing the importance of developing and using environmentally sound alternative 
processes and chemicals, 
 
 
Determined to protect human health and the environment from the harmful impacts of 
persistent organic pollutants, 
 
 
Have agreed as follows: 
 
Article 1 
 
Objective 
 
 
Mindful of the precautionary approach as set forth in Principle 15 of the Rio 
Declaration on Environment and Development, the objective of this Convention is to protect 
human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants.
