Nanomaterials 
Nanomaterial” means a natural, incidental or 
manufactured material consisting of solid particles 
that are present, either on their own or as 
identifiable constituent particles in aggregates or 
agglomerates, and where 50 % or more of these 
particles in the number-based size distribution fulfil 
at least one of the following conditions: 
(a) one or more external dimensions of the particle 
are in the size range 1 nm to 100 nm; 
(b) the particle has an elongated shape, such as a 
rod, fibre or tube, where two external dimensions 
are smaller than 1 nm and the other dimension is 
larger than 100 nm; 
(c) the particle has a plate-like shape, where one 
external dimension is smaller than 1 nm and the 
other dimensions are larger than 100 nm4
